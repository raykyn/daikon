The UMTS auctions were an unfortunately good example of how governments are also managing to shoot Europe and themselves in the foot in the building of an eEurope.
We know how poor the country is, and what an enormous cost this is.
The European Union is founded on a system of values with regard to which the countries of Latin America have made significant progress in recent years.
The Danish Social Democrats are interested, however, in obtaining further clarification of certain points, e.g. the situation of people who work in border areas.

Mr President, these two directives are important when it comes to creating an internal market that operates well.
Thank you, Mrs d'Ancona.
[The guardian of the Constitution. Who should the guardian of the Constitution be?]
Nowhere do I find in your strategy the idea that perhaps the overall concept of the Lisbon Strategy, the concept of liberalisation and privatisation, simply does not work in the interest of the majority of people in many instances, and quite specifically not in the public services sector.
in writing. - (FR) The Schengen Information System (SIS) is a police cooperation tool, the purpose of which is to centralise, and facilitate the exchange of, information relating to persons and vehicles, or other items, jointly sought by Member State police services.
These two things must and shall be amalgamated.
We have to pay more for so-called ‘organic’ products in order to buy what should be normal food.
The draft regulation remains useful even with these limitations.
(FR) Mr President, I would like to comment on point 16 of the Minutes, which quite rightly reports my request for a debate to be held on the waiver of my parliamentary immunity, something which you rejected.
I am very pleased to note this fact.
There are certain things which cause concern: pandering to national sentiments, the high level of corruption, barriers to foreign investment, the abundance of oligarchs on the election lists and the domination of personalities, not election manifestos – these things are all a legacy of the Soviet period.
I take note of that and would point out that I did not refer to 'harmonisation' of taxes but to 'coordination'.
This also affects the question of quota trading, and the value of the quota.
I am therefore fairly optimistic that the vote due to take place later this week will preserve our chances of closing this file in a way that is satisfactory to all three institutions, indeed, in my view quite a number of amendments are already incorporated in one form or another in the common positions.
The Stability and Growth Pact is the European political complement to the single currency, and the single currency is our most important and successful response to globalisation.
I hope the Commission position will reflect that consultation, both of this Parliament, the ACP Group and of course the NGOs you have had discussions with.
At the moment, discussions are focusing on two possible alternatives.
- Madam President, I recommended to my delegates from Ireland to abstain in the votes on both the von Wogau and Vatanen reports, because Ireland has retained its neutrality.
It is widely recognised that small and medium-sized enterprises are the key to reducing unemployment in Europe, yet they face a disproportionate regulatory burden when compared to larger companies due to economies of scale.
I am in favour of discussing the question of what a safe country of origin is, and Hedy d'Ancona has formulated specific definitions.
I have high hopes for REACH.
We could have hoped for an energy treaty like the Euratom Treaty.
There should also be reserves to seek to reduce the existing bureaucracy, for example, in contracting assistants, and we want to 'oblige' the Administration to help reduce this bureaucracy.
Of course, these are but small tragedies and are nothing when compared to the important political project that is the European Union, but let us consider that when we propose special rights on one group of citizens, we automatically degrade the rights of others.
Our committees are working well and I think that we can fairly say that the Joint Parliamentary Assembly can only grow in strength in future years.
But it is not just we Europeans who are shocked by this kind of policy; the US can also pick on Canada, Mexico, South America or anybody else without meeting any resistance worth mentioning.
Within the framework of current legislation, timid efforts are naturally being made to encourage the local film industry and a new, more specific law on films is being considered.
I remember (I was just reading this report) that I wondered, 'Will Mr Blokland,' whom I could see at the controls of the plane, 'also manage to beat the storms, hurricanes and black clouds that I am afraid the environment is bringing us?'
We should not go alone on this, and export refunds are not the problem.
The Commission is monitoring the situation and makes a daily assessment of developments, mainly through its delegation in Moscow.
Now to the second part of my intervention. I would like to stress the role of social dialogue within the framework of this policy.
Commissioner, the last document that Parliament had in relation to budgetary priorities was presented in December last year.
This agreement includes all the measures necessary to establish a free trade area.
I therefore hope that most Member States will automatically apply the directive to all their inland waterways, and that military vessels follow as far as possible the rules applying to all other ships.
But we also want to ask the Council in this extremely important debate exactly how it sees its responsibility vis-à-vis the European Parliament.
The Commission awaits the vote tomorrow.
Basically, I believe that this Convention, which is a great opportunity for European debate and for future stages of European integration to be carried out in a more open, more democratic and more transparent way, is itself responsible for proving that the right method has been chosen, so that we can avoid going back to the old method, which was strictly intergovernmental.
We would encourage the Commission and the Council to pursue this issue vigorously and to unite the European Union in unanimously condemning the death penalty in every forum so as to give rise to a worldwide moratorium on its use.
I think the meeting next week with Pieter Feith, who is also involved in this, will be an opportunity to discuss this further.
I am glad for that reason that we are having the vote today.
We must therefore demand that the whole of a product’s content be taken account of when health claims are made.
That means we have provided aid for Bulgaria to deal with this situation.
.
That has been done only on condition that we and the Council promise to supply the extra resources that may be required for these purposes next year.
Brussels is actually pretty peripheral if I am looking for Scottish football scores on a Saturday.
Some of the uncertainties surrounding the scientific evaluations are due precisely to the fact that there is a lack of such data, as fishermen only tend to pass on data which they think will influence the evaluations in line with their own interests.
So please go ahead and ask the President-in-Office of the Council something else about organised crime.
The President-elect of the Commission, Mr Prodi, has certainly made it clear that he intends to guarantee that the European Commission and the European Parliament will work extremely closely together on the implementation of a comprehensive work programme within the Union over the next five years.
This money comes from allocated funds for Liberia that were never used: because of the situation we could not work there normally.
With regard to the IGC agenda, this is something that is still alive and well, and it is obviously possible to return to the question raised by the honourable Member on that agenda.
The global dimension of terrorism calls for a global response.
The answer is that the choice is always that of the Swiss people, but if they wish to work with us, we have to work with them in a respectful and proper way.
Mr President, I shall conclude.
You need to bear in mind that before data protection was introduced in Europe, the Americans already had far more stringent data protection arrangements than we have, combined with strict rules about passing on data to third parties.
And, if it has adopted them, do those measures make it possible to reduce the violations and the fraud and, more especially, to reduce the risk as a result of speedier and more efficient controls upstream of the procedure?
Or that people should actually see a doctor before starting the treatment?
Comparative advertising is a good thing and it is also a good thing that legislation is coming in, but it will still take another two and a half years - 30 months - before it is finally incorporated into national legislation.
Having said that, I would agree with Mr Perry that one might perhaps wish to see a rather more colourful form of publicity for the Ombudsman, but we can try to provide some inspiration for that in the course of the coming year.
The difference of opinion that still exists between the Council of Ministers and Parliament's Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Protection, when the common position is examined, lies in the fact that the Council is only prepared to apply a limit to the sulphur content of heavy fuel oil as from the start of 2003.
The social dialogue, social policy cooperation and the action programme are important instruments for highlighting political issues and analysing problems. We need all this in order to understand the causes of exclusion, poverty, unemployment, discrimination and globalisation.

We then carried out an individual public hearing for each proposed member, and then, behind closed doors, we held discussions, just amongst the members of the Committee on Budgetary Control.
I would say that there is no part of Iraq which is currently safe.

Mr Byrne, can you tell me how you will be able to ensure that objections at a scientific level are investigated in the shortest possible time so that Member States are not able to repeatedly raise objections and to apply laws without needing to prove their case?

The Group of the European Radical Alliance therefore supports the process of national reconciliation agreed upon by the various political forces in Albania; however, this process seems as yet to have failed to convince the Albanian public, which has risen up against the outrage perpetrated against it by the so-called pyramid saving scheme, a demonstration of all the worst excesses of a free economy.
The question has been raised as to whether it is conceivable that the content of certain measures decided on by the Community within the context of Title IV of the Treaty establishing the European Community may be made applicable in Denmark in any other way.
Recitals g), I) and j) would normally imply refusal of discharge.
Has the Commission decided no longer to consider it a priority to resolve this issue?
It seems that nobody has learned from the lesson of BSE.
If you failed to deliver because you are not happy with the way the Member States are transposing the directive, then that means that the Commission has not fulfilled its duty as guardian of the treaties.
This would suggest that the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development in this House was keenly aware of what needed to be done and was also fiercely critical of the Council and the Commission in this respect, for their handling of BSE policy.
It calls for the introduction of a degressive model of direct payments according to the size of an agricultural holding that are reserved exclusively for active farmers who use farmland for production and maintain it in a good agricultural and environmental condition.
The issue is a technically complicated one, but I shall try here to explain the differences between the two products.

Measures will also be proposed to prevent and manage water shortages and droughts.
VOTES
We have no doubt that it will be easier to reach consensus at this first stage.
Quite naturally, or so I believe, much of our industrial policy is decided on the global market, and hence the great worry about whether the Doha round will be completed, and how things stand with Kyoto, about whether we have yet carried out all the economic analyses that will assure us that achieving the Kyoto targets really will contribute to growth and to the success of the Lisbon Strategy.
In the light of considerations such as operating and transportation risks and the fact that new waste is constantly being produced, nuclear power should be abandoned as a source of energy.
We would also, following the ruling of the Court of Justice of 5 November 2002, which found eight Member States guilty of concluding 'open sky' agreements with the United States, call for the European Commission to present a communication on drawing up future bilateral agreements in the field of air transport as swiftly as possible.
Therefore, neither the European Commission nor the Council is competent to propose any changes in connection with this sort of passport, or any other travel documents.

That was in June 1995.
There is great potential here for an expression of will from Parliament.
I believe that this new criterion makes no sense and is not in accordance with the objective of the future Food Authority which is, above all, health and consumer protection.
The fact is that we do not have an internal market where patents are concerned, so we cannot really destroy it.
We must not increase but reduce the Commission's independence, and we must reduce the excessive privileges this body enjoys: a monopoly on initiative, self-regulation, discretionary powers, and so on.
It also called for the preparation of short-term action plans to deal with acute problems and for more public information and health alerts.
We really do not want a repeat of the absolutely disgraceful situation at Johannesburg, where we were faced with a fait accompli, an agreement already concluded between the Commission - or perhaps the Commissioner responsible, for that mystery has yet to be cleared up - and the United States, that WTO rules should take precedence over international agreements in environmental matters.
I am particularly pleased that on-site checks are being proposed.
After all, just a few weeks ago, we held an extremely instructive debate on the subject in this House that showed the extent of the gulf between aspiration and reality in the very case of consular rights.
That would imply a sentence threshold greater than the twelve months currently established for offences which have not been harmonised among the fifteen Member States.

Nearly one million people were slaughtered, and international intervention came only too late.
Will any liaison be established with those animal welfare organizations which so far, apparently, are the only ones to have exposed the cruelty of this trade?

That is the reason why we provide that the label on chocolate which contains other fat must clearly show that such products are included.
The Treaty of Lisbon has brought us to this point of banning any form of bilateral investment in support of another country and putting all the power in the hands of the Commission, an unelected body.
This House has - for too long, in my view - ignored Christian minority rights in the rest of the world, but they look to the European Union and to the United States for protection.

Israel still of course maintains an open immigration policy based on its status as a home for the Jewish people the world over, but we should also consider the position of Israeli Arabs in society.
In my view, the European Union should promote something that the Presidency mentioned. Without being too specific, it is basically the fact that, clearly, there is a right that we must recognise.
That being said, if we do want to have a role, I, for my part, should like it if you were able to respond, as Commissioner and as the person responsible for these issues at the Commission, to four precise questions:
The departments within the Directorate-General for Regional Policy, in cooperation with those of Mr Potočnik, are working on a communication to provide information and advice on how to combine the resources of cohesion and RDT policy in order to increase their respective effectiveness, which is to be adopted in July.
Although the directive on advice to consumers is only half complete, I think that detergent manufacturers could voluntarily increase consumer awareness and so also reduce the burden on the environment.
The efforts of an individual Member State or of the European Union alone will not be sufficient to tackle this.
Everything he does is accurate and practical, and such is the case with this report.
Mr President, by setting up a currency union with a common currency, twelve of the EU Member States have taken considerable risks with employment.
We have, however, also been able to identify possible ways forward and believe that all of them can be resolved.
Clearly, it is in Turkey’s interest, too, to reach a settlement quickly, because this would prevent the Cyprus issue from becoming an obstacle to its own aspirations.
(RO) There are many good aspects in this report and I will support it, but I will vote against the absurd amendments from the right-wing on reproductive rights.
The Commission presented them at the end of April 2005.
To this end, the European Council called on the Council of Ministers to speed up its work and asked it to approve the provisions on family reunification by July 2003.
Clearly, if there were to be a mistranslation of such an important amendment, or indeed of any amendment, it would be a very serious matter, and we shall check that very carefully.

Vietnam enforces preventive censorship, and all media are under party control.

Mr Herzog said that there is no Community logic in the networks, which is clear in some cases, and that in order to establish this internal market in the gas and electricity sectors we do not just need regulatory standards, but also infrastructures that support this idea of an internal market, and security within this internal market that allows sufficient capacity for peak demand points; extraordinary increases or extraordinary situations.
Such occasions are an opportunity for all the critics of European integration to see the enthusiasm, joy and expectation with which the public greets outstanding cultural events inspired by the quest for common European roots.
I welcome the agreement that Baroness Ashton must protest against the incident at the Italian embassy, because this involves not just Italy but the entire European Union.

Time is of the essence.
The crisis has wiped out millions of jobs and has aggravated job insecurity and poverty - 17% of EU residents are at risk of poverty.
It is a matter of cooperating in the area of fishing.
I believe the mystery should be removed from the whole project, because this is about nothing other than ensuring that foreign investors and investments do not enjoy less favourable treatment than domestic investors and investments.
Nonetheless, this compromise does deserve our support.
Another case relating to the more general problem of the incorrect implementation of the personnel scope of the directives concerning the coordination of the procedures for the award of public works contracts and of public supply contracts has still to come before the Court.
The challenges facing the European Union, the result of demographic changes, require a concrete plan for combating health inequalities in rural areas.
It is not surprising either that the fight against poverty, social exclusion and social divisions continued to be marginalised at the Summit and was not linked at all with consistent action to tackle global warming and the destruction of the environment.
I should like to propose bringing forward the debate on the report by Díaz de Mera García Consuegra on EUROPOL and taking it as the second item before the Council and Commission statements on the situation in Pakistan.
It would contravene the Rules.
This is an important measure that will contribute to social cohesion in Europe as poorer regions will be favoured, and to the fight against obesity among young people.

Nevertheless, I would have liked to see more men involved in this work.

For me, the issue is not that of knowing whether gas can be purchased from the Devil.
in writing. - (NL) What is this Parliament meddling in now?
Saddam's hand in this - his amnesty for almost 100 000 criminals just before the start of the military intervention by the Americans and the British - does not discharge the Americans in particular of their responsibility to provide for law and order in the administrative centre of the country.

Mr President, I would like to point out that I was present yesterday.
The Irish Government has so far refused to do this.

We were told that we would meet the Commissioner of Social Affairs on the maintenance of driving and rest times.
In my opinion, France has no need of a European Railway Agency or more European regulation in order to free up its roads. It needs a government that will assume its responsibilities and tackle the causes of the problem.
What is clear is that the reductions in the number of people paying income tax because of the increased unemployment and the increased number of people dependent on social security payments will seriously affect the achievement of the debt and deficit targets of Member States in the European Union, and I draw Members' attention particularly to the situation in Germany.
You were more successful than the President in doing that job because everyone has heard you now.

Mr President, it is not easy to be fair in a pernicious climate where anything goes.
Therefore this is a very mixed debate on how we are going to make sure we can make the European Union run effectively.
Drawing up such a list seems unnecessary to me and, in particular, runs the risk of penalising those ports which are not yet entirely suitable, but which are being converted for this purpose.

It is only right that Parliament should not be silent on the Chechnya question, for example.
Emphasis should be put on: the creation of alternative forms of employment in the drought-affected areas to improve the irrigation systems in use in these affected areas and, in general, improve water conservation; the introduction of more drought-resistant and less water-hungry crops through further research into new crops, pilot schemes, model farms and whatever is necessary to farm in a sustainable manner in this environment.
I also wonder what the difference was last year when Ireland faced the same situation and instituted hard cuts.

My group particularly welcomes the fact that this meeting looks set to agree an air ticket levy with proceeds going to benefit some of the world’s poorest people.

First: we need to create a pan-European system of security and political dialogue, mainly under the auspices of the ?SCE, in order to forestall any concern on Russia's part about the integration of the Baltic states and Poland into the European Union.
We voted against the joint resolution, noting that everyone who signed it has huge political responsibility in misleading the people as to the future of the UN and, at the same time, accepting the imperialist barbarism which needs to be overturned.

Perhaps that is a way of reconciling the European public with 'Europe'.
Another important amendment is Amendment No 16, on the need for states to take the necessary measures to be able to act in coordination with one another.
I will not quote in full the provisions of those regulations, and more particularly Articles 42, 46, 49 and 52, but their spirit is clear. This is that neither the voting members of the boards, nor the chairperson or executive director, shall seek or take instructions from EU institutions or bodies, Member State governments or any public or private body, and that these, in turn, shall not seek to influence the chair or the executive director in the performance of their tasks.

The EU is about harmonisation, not people, so the unelected Commissioner will take away UK imperial distances and traditions via the back door without asking the people.
The next item is two oral questions (B5-0094/2003 and B5-0095/2003) by Mr Brok to the Council and the Commission on a renewed transatlantic partnership for the third millennium.
It is also very much in the interests of Turkey because it maintains the strong incentive to implement and consolidate the necessary legal and political reforms.
But we do not manage very well with 15 countries at the moment.
Words are therefore important in themselves because of the ideas they express and the messages they convey, or rather suggest.
Parliament expressly drew attention to these serious accounting errors during the discharge procedures for 1996, 1997 and 1998.
The request is outside the deadline, but if it is accepted...
Why?
In my view, to achieve this, it is necessary to maintain and expand the objectives of cohesion policy that have applied to date.

The directive has yet to be accepted by the Council.
(Applause)
The figures have already been cited. In Europe, fewer than 1 in 3 800 women die from pregnancy-related causes, but the figure is very much higher in some African countries: 1 in 16.

After the Commission under Jacques Santer was censured, a zero tolerance approach was announced, along with the establishment of OLAF – (the European Anti-Fraud Office).
If I talk of things like Agent Orange, you will know exactly what I mean.

I would like to know if this was justified, if it was just a precaution, and how vulnerable our system really is.
I look at the empty seats over there and see that the Council appears not to be interested either in the work of the Ombudsman or in the work of the Committee on Petitions.
In Europe we have come so far - I only need to mention the implementation of Schengen, meaning that there are no longer any controls at the vast majority of borders - that nothing else is simply good enough anymore.

The vote will take place tomorrow at 9 a.m.

This marking will help to intensify inspections of poultry farms and restore consumer confidence in this sector.
That is why the report calls for a European supply directive with adequate indemnification provisions.
From the perspective of the European Union it is important that the deal secured by our leaders in Berlin last year, and endorsed by Parliament in terms of the future administration of the CAP for the period 2000-2006, is not reopened in any shape or form.
What, however, we do not agree on is the harmonization of criminal law, for example, and whether that should be desirable.
The European airlines’ scepticism as to the effectiveness of this instrument, due to the difficulty in proving that carriers from other, non-Community countries are operating unfairly by setting their ticket prices too low, will depend only on the Commission’s ability to put this instrument into practice.
The violation of democratic principles means that we must necessarily put our partnership agreement with Belarus on hold and freeze its funds from TACIS, apart from those intended for democracy programmes.
I sought assurances at that time that the President and Quaestors would investigate the matter.
In some parts there are very high levels of unemployment, maybe as high as 75 %.

A further two amendments have been added.
The agreement has taken the form of an agreed minute which corresponds, although with a simplified and more flexible format, to the main text of the agreement with Canada and the Russian Federation.

We have the Agency for Fundamental Rights.
The Commission will work very closely with the Slovenian Presidency on central issues of its programme, such as the stability of the Western Balkans, Kosovo, and Bosnia in particular, but also enlargement, the European neighbourhood policy, asylum and immigration, cooperation with strategic partners and intercultural dialogue.
I am also pleased with regard to those states with the special provisions included, though I must point out that they may not be sufficient, in which case additional measures will be required.
In view of the large quantities involved and in an effort to develop more and better cooperation among the Member States and harmonisation within the Union, the Commission advocates the establishment of some general guidelines for the decommissioning of nuclear facilities.
There is an urgent need for reform here.
Madam President, Commissioner, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, ladies and gentlemen, when we speak today about what lessons we have learned from the Chernobyl disaster - the full extent of which we are, of course, as yet unaware, since we do not know what consequences will be suffered by unborn generations or how the contaminated landscape will develop in years to come - I have to conclude that we have not learned the necessary lessons and that many years have passed without anyone taking the action that really ought to have been taken in the wake of the Chernobyl disaster.
So we in my group think that the Titley report in response to the Commission communication is an extremely important document.
Thank you, Mrs Schmidbauer.
However, it is very possible that, very shortly, that party's position may not be the same as the one expressed by the Council the other day, as our experience over many years suggests.
No one has been able to prove their existence in Romania.
The explosion in broadcasting technologies has caused many parents to lose control over what their children watch, and the growth of digital, cable and satellite TV, as well as home computer technology, means that parents are increasingly powerless to monitor their children's viewing habits.
If you seek to make it dependent on the votes of that gentleman, whose three or four votes just might help the Commission get a majority, then you are weakening Europe.
This should not, and cannot, entail the undermining of our principle of voluntary 'gratis' self-sufficiency.
Secondly, our Parliament would like the good ecological status of seas and oceans to be defined with a great deal more precision so that this is not some sort of pious hope and so that we come closer to doing what can be done to restore the life and balance of the ecosystem.
We should not arouse false expectations.
I should like to reiterate the importance of this area.
That is what the issue is about and, when Mr Napolitano now tells us that he is immediately to call an extraordinary meeting of the committee, he might perhaps be requested to see to it that this fundamental issue of legality and the legal basis is examined, at least in such a way that some indications of the legal issue emerge.
The reformed common agricultural policy is going to have a vitally important role to play in confronting issues like food security, market volatility and climate change, but I want to mention three other principles which, to my mind, are no less important.
MEPs are directly elected and answerable to our constituents.
The goal in doing this is to make potential beneficiaries more aware of these funds, and to monitor their use more effectively.
Together with my colleagues Gérard Caudron and Anne Van Lancker, I have tabled a motion for a resolution, because there is European work to be done.

So even among the largest firms, the spread is so great that there will always be competition.
And even in the Europe of 27 members, in other words including our Romanian and Bulgarian friends, the CAP would have been reduced by over 5% in the period in question.

I entirely agree with the President of the Commission about the need to prepare such a list along the lines of a constitution, and I am quite clear about the fact that the subsidiarity principle must be reinforced and that the EU must therefore refrain from making policy on the wide range of areas in which the political problems are not of a cross-border nature.
I therefore voted in favour of the directive on the energy performance of buildings, because it is expected to have a significant impact on the life of European citizens, given that it directly affects the buildings in which they live and which they use.

There are many other paragraphs in the Penal Code which restrict freedom of speech. I do not want to list them all, but there is still a great deal of work to do here.
Solutions for better reconciliation of work and family life do not lie in one specific measure.

These measures will allow us to create around 7 million jobs across Europe by 2020.
If you, Commissioner, really had taken note of what Parliament proposed at first reading, you would have been able to achieve all these lofty objectives, of which I am in favour, and it would have been possible without red tape and burdensome impositions, for these nutrient profiles are beyond my comprehension, and I cannot forget how Mr Podger from the Food Safety Authority said quite clearly that he did not know how he was meant to arrive at them.
If we in this House and in this European Union do something to help the Kurds, we shall actually be doing something for Turkey and helping to bring it closer to the rest of Europe.
The report is a mid-term review of this flagship initiative, assessing the process and implementation so far and launching the debate on its future governance, exploitation and financing in the EU system.
And, if we speak about security, we have to mention the security implications of nuclear energy, namely nuclear proliferation, and we see the problems that we have with that in other very high-profile security issues.
Unfortunately, this is unlikely to happen at the moment and, therefore, I have voted against the motion.

My intervention was not in response to Mr Tannock's intervention.
Lastly, a word on incorporating the Charter.
Several Member State governments are jeopardising the independence of their regulators by amending the relevant laws, to enable them to appoint ministerial officials with the obvious aim of bringing pressure to bear on price regulation.
Are there any other comments?
We put in a great deal of effort for very little result.
At the meeting of the Committee on Foreign Affairs, Mr Jarzembowski, I adopted a position, and I see that gradually the position I adopted is being confirmed.
Are we comparing like with like if we are opening up professions in one Member State to another?

Mr President, as the last speaker said a moment ago, a debate on ‘Women on Waves’ soon changes into a debate on abortion, about a woman’s right to choose.
At the request of the GUE/NGL Group and with the consent of all groups, I propose that statements on the situation in Gaza by Mr Javier Solana, High Representative for the Common Foreign and Security Policy, who is already with us and to whom I bid a very warm welcome, and by the Commission be added to today's agenda as item 2, following the statements on the situation in Iran.

Secondly, on the withdrawals in January 2003, the DPRK announced that it intended to withdraw from the NPT - it was the first state to do so.

Given the challenges to the multilateral system that Secretary-General Annan has placed in the spotlight in such a determined way – including last Friday at the World Economic Forum in Davos – the central thrust of this report, which reaffirms support for a strong, reformed UN at the centre of the multilateral system, is very welcome.
I note that, as far as the inordinately light sentences on those accused of instigating murderous riots against Christians in Upper Egypt were concerned, the Court of Appeal in Egypt has ordered a retrial.

It is essential to ensure a better position for these films in third-country markets.
I have the feeling, Mr President, that at the moment, and despite the fact that I think it is right for the Commission to try to harmonise measures, we must remember Articles 174 and 176 of the European Union Treaty – which are in place – which, on the one hand, empower the States to adopt measures to better protect the environment, but on the other, encourage the Community institutions to adopt general measures, so that a problem as serious as the one we have today with the accumulation of solid waste can be resolved in the only rational way, which is the Community way.
Voting time (continued)
I should also like to say that, within the climate and energy bundle, the European Union is successfully and thoroughly preparing all those measures with which we can effectively counter the consequences of the climate change.
However, we are moving on, we are making progress.
Then there is the complex question of vaccination, even if it is not on the Irish agenda.

In the case of Eurodac, how do we know that these special searches were not unauthorised access by national agencies masquerading as searches on behalf of individuals checking their own data?

I can assure you that actions against mines and explosive remnants of war will continue to be carried out through the new geographical instruments, and are even being mainstreamed now - and this is new - into our external assistance strategies and programmes.

We now have to deal with the question of how best to go in that direction.
I also expected France to be congratulated on having implemented a measure for preventive diplomacy, a measure to which the European Union, if it had been a good sport, would have been able to lend its support.

Finally, as regards carbon taxes, I believe that the taxes should not be increased but regularised.
Why would we in developing countries take away with one hand what we give them with European development policy?
But if our strategy is to be credible, we must start by setting a good example and thus proceeding unilaterally, as countries of the European Union, to dismantle the arsenals of mines that exist in Europe and stopping the manufacture of mines, including those not intended for export.
I would also wish the French Presidency every success.

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, Commissioner, on behalf of the Group of the European Liberal Democrat and Reform Party I would like to congratulate the rapporteur Mrs Quisthoudt on her report and thank her for the work she has carried out, because it is above all thanks to her that the Committee on Research, Technological Development and Energy has managed to come up with a unanimous proposal for the budget of the Fifth Framework Programme.

One of the consequences of the liberalisation of world trade is heavy job losses and a worsening of the social situation in a number of regions and countries, including Portugal, which are more dependent on certain productive sectors, such as the textile and clothing sector, for example.
To do this, we must create wealth and economic growth.
The first bouquet I am throwing is because of the introduction of PR for euro elections - a long awaited improvement in our lot.

The aim will be to develop the programme further and very much more precisely, to adapt it to the needs of these actual regions.
It is a huge burden of extra work for farmers, but well worth it to get the market opened up.
Giving this task to the Portuguese Presidency is an attempt to place all the responsibility for what may happen on the shoulders of one country which cannot, at the wrong time and on its own, solve a problem which concerns us all.
This report is based on a series of seminars with the members of the Commission' s own high level group on charging for infrastructures and on an information conference on best practice in charging for infrastructures.
For a number of years, the European economy has been growing at a rate less than its full potential.
I had the opportunity of travelling to Angola with him quite recently. I do not think we disagreed on any of the issues we saw there, so his analysis is my analysis and I fully support it.
My question expresses the concern of large groups of SMEs and your response, Commissioner, will influence the way I vote tomorrow.
At the same time, the fraudulent practices of the food industry, which conquers markets in order to sell products that are harmful to health, will be curbed.

Finally, there is the objective that we are pursuing in a very hands-on way, which is to improve the manner in which environment is incorporated into every relevant policy, plan and programme, and especially in the course of the health and environment programme that is to run from 2004 to 2010.
Why does the Management Board not have an equal number of members appointed by the Commission and the Council respectively, and why is the position of Executive Director not to be publicly advertised in the same way as the posts of other heads of important EU authorities?
At the same time, I am convinced that these would be regarded as a significant expression of Turkey' s resolve to move closer to the European model.
We did take action, spurred on of course by the good intentions of all democratic countries who wish to defend the rights being violated in others.
On behalf of my group, I recognise and welcome the fact that for the first time in the urgency debates we have enjoyed the involvement and contribution of the Council.
This drive is all the more important given that we must overcome the challenge posed by enlargement.
Therefore, in this context, given the wide variation of climatic conditions across Europe, I consider it appropriate that decisions regarding the health and safety of workers from exposure to sunlight are best taken by the national authorities.
The cause is the failure of intergovernmental Europe, of its massive democratic deficit, of its weak legitimacy, of its becoming bogged down in unanimity and nationalistic rivalry.
Everybody has to work in a spirit of compromise and what we have got on the table has something for everybody.
I trust it will prove possible to adopt both these texts. I also hope the Council will find a way of being more accommodating, or that it will at least prevail on certain Member States to moderate their position.
The core of this item for me is how to achieve concrete improvements in the situation in Tibet.
Achieving competitive businesses and securing continued economic growth are tasks requiring a concerted effort.
This is very good news.
This is the content of the amendments I have presented and which the rapporteur has been kind enough to incorporate.
That is why, Commissioner, I consider the Commission's current approach, which is based exclusively on the Treaties and on the Court of Justice, to be inadequate and dangerous.
I am convinced that the best way to counter the crisis is with more free trade and globalisation, not with protectionism.
This has in fact to do with the work involved in bringing in the new Financial Regulation.
The Presidency is active in this regard.
Indeed, some postal services, advantaged by particularly competitive tariffs, practice unfair competition by giving incentives to mail reposting, and so poach from the national mail services business which they handle as international mail services, since the mail is deposited or sorted with them outside national boundaries.
Mr Marty has serious difficulty distinguishing between facts and speculation.
In parts of the country from which I come, transit traffic has come to constitute an intolerable nuisance.
Their land adjoins ours.
Our Committee was also keen on consistency with REACH and therefore tabled amendments concerning tonnage.
I do not know.
The key is to stress to President Bush - while he is here, in Europe - as well as to other Member States that aid is not an opportunity to reduce First World agricultural surpluses, but that he should buy local with aid money.
And that begins at the very top, in the leadership of the Council of Ministers: all those male leaders who are not taking it seriously.
It is the same trend, and, indeed, when you say that 'Europe is a combination of values and the capacity to take action', what do you think the relationship is between values and action?
For example, the Baptist representative, Mr Rashid Durebayev, has also been tried and may possibly face three years in prison.
As you know, Mr Colom i Naval and myself attended the Council meeting last Monday and since the Council wants to be transparent it is my duty to report on what we heard.
We are still terribly wary.
It is what happens in between the summits that matters, and I urge you, Commissioners, to use your legislative powers and your monitoring ability to ensure that what was said at Johannesburg, even if it is not enough, is carried through.
The principle of subsidiarity must be considered to a high degree in this context, as must the financial framework.
Some can be accepted partially or with limited changes.
However, in accordance with the Rules, I must now continue with the next question.
The EU has been taking part in the IGF since its inception, but the fact that it is being held in Vilnius makes our delegation even more relevant.

I should like to congratulate the rapporteur once again and say on behalf of my group that this is a very successful report.
But if that should happen, which could be justified for certain groups within society, then I think the national consumer organizations should be responsible for them.

Member of the Commission. - Mr President, first of all let me congratulate Mr Belder for this very good report.
To conclude, I wish to express my satisfaction that Europe is finally taking our neighbours in the East seriously by adopting a strategic partnership with Armenia, Azerbaijan, Belarus, Georgia, the Republic of Moldova and Ukraine.
Looking beyond making the statement or its implications in domestic policy terms, the right of an MEP to express himself or herself must be recognised as a freedom and therefore defended.
Our European model of society, the combination of a free economy with a high degree of social protection, must be preserved in a sustainable way, and this will take growth.
Mr President, normally I would complain that one minute is not enough to sum up a presidency in its latter stages, but not in this instance.

Sadly, tragic stories make good articles and increase the incomes of tabloid newspapers.
It is a sign of confidence that corresponds to the development of your institution.
This proposal provides a reliable legal framework that will allow the Commission to continue to take action on the basis of new scientific findings and at the same time to maintain the level of protection of human and animal health in the European Union or to raise it if that is scientifically justified.
To go that one stage further would add a new dimension to the European elections, make them more understandable to the public and have a visible effect, at least on the chief executive.
As far as others are concerned, they have been made aware of it. We have also set up certain research programmes to help to find solutions.
I take the opposite view because, for somebody who goes out to the fields in Mozambique or goes outside the village in Cambodia, it is an urgent matter of survival.
It violates and infringes human rights and freedoms and restricts access to them.
Based on a comparison with experience in the United States, it seems to me that this call system forms part, in the broad sense, of the issue of portability and the single market, as it is a means that enables the user to make calls any public or private phone, using simple procedures.
The measures designed for this purpose include streamlining the procedure in the event of nuclear emergency and the clear assignment to the Commission of a supervisory role, which, at the same time, clarifies the regime of its acts.

Whilst recognizing that flexibility can contribute to finding an acceptable solution for everyone at Kyoto, we have clearly stated that the priority condition for possible acceptance of an element of flexibility is the existence of sufficiently ambitious objectives.
There are problems with farmers' overstating how much land they have, and pathetic control systems at quite a few custom houses.

One of the things we can of course do with the Social Fund is to train the staff and help have better care for those people, but the basis decision on whether or not to have a foster house lies with the national governments.

However your solutions are extremely weak.
For that reason, I believe that the necessary funds should be allocated to the budget on the basis of a scientific needs assessment.
Mr President, I shall briefly explain some of the points where we have some concerns with the amendments which have been proposed by this Parliament.
To put it simply, it was not necessary to meddle with the workings of the European legal framework. This concept, like that of the framework directive, is ambiguous, because nobody knows exactly what should go into it, from authorised subsidies to the definition of the service itself, via organisational principles, obligations and relations with service users.
The waste of resources for ourselves as MEPs is also considerable, and there are always problems in getting here, what with cancelled and delayed planes etc.
There are probably arguments in favour of both sides.

It is not my role to react on behalf of or in respect of individual Member States.
.
For them it is a matter of survival.
We should ask why we are speeding up the liberalisation process when the 1991 directive has only just been revised.
We should be glad that the emphasis has, at last, been placed on entering into political and cultural rather than just economic exchange.
We are opposed, however, to the idea of specific objectives for each material, since they would lead to a distortion in competition between materials and reduce the consumer's scope for choice.
As this is not a matter of urgency, why not grant us an additional reflection period?
That is why it is important that the Member States should have the option of giving individual regions special designations, and thus apply a higher quality standard than the general European standard prescribed by the Directive.
The declaration that democratic accountability will be guaranteed or that the aims of the ECB will be broadened to include other aims apart from monetary stability is a conscious attempt at disorientation, when not only is this not provided for in the Treaties but, on the contrary, the Treaties make every provision for the independence of the ECB from any possible national intervention. These provisions restrict the number of people on its board, thereby ensuring that it is not represented by all Member States.
Mr President, Commissioner, as Mrs Sudre rightly emphasises in her very commendable and extensive report, it is indisputable that the outermost regions have five characteristics which put them at a permanent or very long-lasting disadvantage.
The report published shows that there was a low uptake of funds and these were allotted mainly to big business, while small business did not receive the required funding.

In a Europe which wants to be close to the citizens, can we continue to see sport just as a commercial activity?
Finland, thanks to the commitment and tenacity of its President, Martti Ahtisaari, caused a shift in the mind set in Kosovo from one of war to one of peace.
We will have to consider how it is going to be done.
My sense of responsibility demands that I vote against the Commission tomorrow.
Unfortunately, when this subject is under discussion, they are not here!
That debate will include the participation of the Council of Ministers and of the Presidency-in-Office.
The inclusion of safety and territorial cohesion as priority objectives will doubtless improve the design of future transport policy and will contribute to making its practical application fit with the public's expectations, needs and possibilities.
Having said that, I have discharged my duty as the coordinator.
The Minister said he had not received satisfactory answers from the Chinese authorities so far.
This is the heart of the issue, because we do not understand the point of persisting with a review of instruments that everyone thinks are useful and are working well.
The Court of First Instance has already stated a number of times that the procedure must be amended.
I should like, first of all, to congratulate Ivo Belet on his excellent report on this highly important subject.
If the Commission is now thinking about producing savings from agriculture for a new programme to benefit farmers in developing countries, then people are welcome to discuss where these will come from.

State of the Transatlantic dialogue (RC B5-0342/2001 and RC B5-0345/2001)
We are discussing the extension of the European police coordination mandate to include the most serious crimes; indeed we are aware that the coordination of information is, in itself, an implementing power, and that the distinction between coordination powers and implementing powers is very, very fine, hazy and difficult to define; we are therefore plumbing the depths of Member States' police and police cooperation policies. The implications for our countries and our codes of criminal procedure are huge, for, as we know, procedures vary greatly between the 15 Member States in terms of the relationship between the police and the law and the government.
The logic of not unveiling here - as the Commissioner himself said to me - the strategy that is to be revealed at the said negotiations, is justified and worthy of respect.
We have objections to three amendments: Nos 11, 12 and 19.
Indeed recently these countries seem to have embarked on a race to catch up.

If there are more leftovers from any decision taken on 13 December, then the European public as a whole will see that as a failure on the part of the European Union’s Heads of State or Government.
The Commission does not share this view and nor do other European partners.
With regard to the USA letter, that letter is obviously appreciated, there is no doubt about that, but to state that Parliament's views will be heard, considered and responded to is a bit weak, is it not?
I, too, asked the Council for an increase in Leonardo funds on Wednesday during the presidency debate.
Let us put an end to complicated procedures where a decision has to be endorsed twenty times and it is impossible afterwards to say who is really responsible.
It is therefore likely that world stocks will be further reduced and prices will go up again.
There are certainly still a few things to be done and there are still a few issues that need to be clarified.
Over all, Commissioner, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, in the absence of co-decision I think we have contributed enlightened and well thought-out opinions.
Madam President, Mrs Schauvliege, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the commitments made in 1992 in Rio and in 2002 in Johannesburg have not been respected.

Therefore the EU must change its current rules on the banana trade for several reasons: because it is in accordance with our international commitments, because it would benefit consumers, and because there are more effective ways to support the developing countries within the ACP in their efforts to find forward-looking structures of production.
.
These changes are mostly positive ones and take account of the amendments that we tabled and adopted in the Agriculture Committee.
We do not want to live through another accident like the Erika.
I should also emphasise to Mr Blokland and others who make reference to being lobbied by consumers who have written letters, that may be the case.
I began by expressing the reasons I had for specifically going to Bethlehem, and that was to recognise that although I was in the Middle East, I was also in the heart, in a sense, of many religions - specifically on the eve of the Orthodox Christmas.
We do not know how much, in practice, that role will increase, but we do know that it will increase.
As municipal elections are being held in Greece in October 1998, it has been agreed with the Greek government that the publicity and information campaign co-financed by the Structural Funds is to be postponed from August to October in order to forestall any possible criticism.

Military violence has no place in the political spectrum in the resolution of conflicts.

As I said a moment ago, this report does not give rise to keen argument. That does not mean, however, that it lacks significance from a technical point of view.
I would also like to emphasise the importance of something close to us in the Nordic countries, which people are not always sufficiently aware of in more southern parts of Europe, which is that the most important aspect of renewable energy is the biomass that comes from the natural forest, such as branches, crowns and small-diameter trees in a thinned-out forest.
As the time allotted to questions to the Commission has elapsed, Questions Nos 35 to 76 will be replied to in writing (3).

In order however to strip back those obligations to their minimum, we are not just talking about it; we will be appointing in the very near future a deputy secretary-general, an additional deputy secretary-general with the specific mandate and mission of identifying best practices and spreading them throughout the Commission and of ensuring a radical reduction in the procedures which generate so much paper, so much bureaucracy and I must say so much frustration, not only for the citizens and businesses of the Union but for the people who work for the Commission too.
The fight against corruption and increasing transparency in the work of the public administration should also be an important element of reform.

These also feature highly in the report submitted by Wim van Velzen, which is a precise and focussed piece of work, and we intend further to improve the situation through amendments from the Group of the European People's Party.

One wonders what is political about this debate: this is a matter of substance.
It is also vital to include measures targeting high-risk environments, such as prisons.
The previous President has clearly discriminated in favour of other MEPs who have been allowed to speak longer than they should have done.
Let us remember, too, the first anniversary of the elections in Iran, particularly in view of the intense repression which is being widely used there.
The only detail I omitted was the date when they took place.
What I do not agree with is the cuts made to the Leonardo programme.
I have one question. Recently, we have spoken a great deal about the crisis and how to overcome it.

This week’s European Council in Brussels takes place at the end of a tumultuous year for the European Union.
Mr President, on September 16 the European Parliament adopted a resolution condemning the offences committed against minorities in the Serbian province of Vojvodina and, as a consequence of this, in late 2004, a delegation led by Mrs Doris Pack visited the province on a fact-finding mission.
Mr President, my delegation voted in favour of this Commission because all along we believed this was a matter of competence of the Commissioners.
Then the issues were the quality of the growth that we are bringing about, sustainability and biodiversity.
This report, however, goes well beyond the immediate ambitions of even those who drive ESDP at the moment.
In this attempt to achieve bolder and more ambitious results, I also believe that in the final phase of the COP 16 negotiations, the European Union should give its chief negotiator some flexibility to react to developments thrown up by the negotiations.
It is very important that we ensure as soon as possible that the European Union is an area in which researchers, technologies and knowledge can move freely, where there is effective coordination of research activities and where the best possible use is made of resources.
I do not think it is a good idea therefore to describe in detail what I have already mentioned in my reply, in accordance with the usual and precise procedure.
This is where the difficulty lies.
As you know, the item has not been removed from the agenda but rather its duration has been reduced.
As far as I am concerned and as far as the board of EuropeAid is concerned, it is imperative to ensure that among our performance indicators there is one which gives us an indication of progress made in moving all the management of projects into the delegations, where it should be.
Ladies and gentlemen, the Community's producers are expecting a major political gesture from us today.
Precisely because the Austrians are already exemplary in separating and recycling waste, I am delighted that all the other Member States will now be taking part in these operations, thereby bringing us another step closer to efficient protection of the environment.
Mr Jørgensen came in very late on, because he is a new Member.
Thank you very much Mr President-in-Office of the Council.
I believe that the Romanian Government has problems in estimating the number of orphans who are presently in the orphanage system in that country.
I agree with Mr Linkohr that we must make more funding available for research, but, for as long as we are unable to fund uncontroversial projects, we have to think even more carefully than the Commission suggests about why we want to support controversial ones.
We cannot therefore recommend to many of the developing countries that they cooperate with us in the middle of the crisis.
First of all, as regards Mr van Velzen's report on the framework decision, most of the proposed amendments clarify the Commission's proposal.
Hundreds of people were dispossessed of their homes and there are reliable reports of his security forces torturing, raping, and even killing, local residents.
Do not think that if you Council Members simply tell us to speed up, we will have an agreement in June.
The expanded European Union unifies Member States having different histories and past experiences, and they possess different approaches towards relations with Russia.
I would also be very grateful if some corrections could be made, because some of the translations of Mrs Wemheuer's resolution into various languages are incorrect.
I know there are those who have reservations about this, but if we are honest with ourselves the number of mind-bogglingly trivial amendments that we have to deal with is astonishing.
It is a great honour to be able to talk to you today.
The Presidency will prepare thoroughly for the summit between the EU and Ukraine that is due to take place during the United Kingdom Presidency.
This is where the Toy Safety Directive, which has been in existence for a long time, needs to be revised.
I asked the Commissioner a direct question.
When we see the destructured form this sector takes in the developing countries, it is impossible to hide behind the most-favoured-nation clause of the GATT to deny ourselves the right to take action in defence of our textile industries, action which would be beneficial to all.
It is true what you were saying about the huge efforts that have been made.
Commissioner, although efforts that come to nothing may be dispiriting, the Commission must do everything it possibly can to enable the agreement to be concluded and to put an end to the sense of stagnation and pessimism recently surrounding the multilateral and bilateral trade negotiations.
Vice-President of the Commission. - (IT) Madam President, honourable Members, I believe that first of all we need to emphasise that it is not the Commission's job to interpret Court of Justice rulings.

My report aims to answer both the legitimate concerns of thousands of women and the need to put patient safety first.
Care must always be taken to uphold the principle that the sustainability of fishery resources must be guaranteed in order to ensure that fisheries activities are viable, that fleets can continue to operate, that jobs can be maintained and that fishing communities can be developed.
The rapporteur seemed to suggest that there was some misunderstanding about this, but that is how it comes across.
It is very important for Europe to find its place by defining itself and defending the values that it created in the cradle of revolutions, in the books written by its brilliant minds, and in the cries of its peoples.
What I find entirely unacceptable, however, is that, in a way, he prevented me from speaking on all the other matters on which the Rules of Procedure allowed me to speak.
But it did not necessarily or automatically resolve the unemployment problem.
The next item is the joint debate on the following six motions for resolutions on the situation in Sudan:

Mr President, I should like to move the following small addition to recital H, which deals with the execution of Saddam Hussein: 'and deploring the way it was carried out'.
Nonetheless, the European Union has taken the option of building relations with Libya in order to be able to address all issues in an open and constructive manner, including very sensitive ones like human rights, the respect for fundamental freedoms and the rights of migrants.
This could lead to barriers to trade - with regard to imports from third countries, and so on - in breach of the WTO agreements.
But what you cannot ask of the Commission is that it take the view that a country has definitively fulfilled the deficit criterion when the Council has not yet abrogated the excessive deficit procedure.
Despite all the justified criticism of Greece - and the Greek Members will realise that there is much to be done in their country - the crisis is by no means solely the responsibility of Greece.
Parents seem to be unaware that the risk of their children suffering a serious or even fatal injury as a result of an accident is seven times greater if they are not wearing a seat belt.
I should like to congratulate the Croatian authorities on the positive results they have achieved so far in preparation for membership of the European Union.
We also have to reduce a lot of Europe’s deficits.
I believe that its first port of call should be to restore its political credibility, the political credibility of the European Union.

In fact, as I see it, Eurobonds could be put back on the agenda in a Delors-style initiative.
We had not had any discussions for a while.
This is, however, a discussion which should be pursued outside this Parliament.
We saw a vast number of people walking great distances – as they were obliged to – in order to reach the polling stations.
(DE) Mr President, the speeches by Mrs Roithová, Mr Březina and Mr Mészáros really convinced me, since they described how there was similarly indiscriminate exploitation in the country in which they lived previously, namely Communist Czechoslovakia, how there has been a change in attitude and how today, they are the ones who are advocating environmental protection and common European standards.
We thus have reason to believe that the national parliaments are informed and can take their part in the monitoring and control of development programmes.
While the European Union and many agencies in the Member States work very hard and with great commitment, supported by NGOs, to protect species, this conversation demonstrated once again that many people see the protection and maintenance of biodiversity as something of a luxury.
Medicines are an essential factor in protecting health.
As Parliament is aware, the five cases to which I have referred are all from the environment sector, and as you also know, they are the very first to be brought under this new provision of the Treaty in Article 171.
That is why we are waiting for the announcement made by the President-in-Office of the European Union to become reality soon, an announcement echoing, among other things, a heartfelt plea by the Italian Minister, Franco Frattini, to launch a debate so that we can find a way to share fairly among Member States the burdens and responsibilities associated with the flows of illegal immigrants and political asylum seekers.
Just as we do not want a financial market that does not function properly and that is closed and completely unregulated, we do not want an electricity market that operates like the financial market did before the crisis either.

As Mr Liese pointed out just now, human beings clearly come before economic issues, which can be dealt with at any time.
For farmers, simplification is undoubtedly one of the forms, one of the faces of the Arlésienne.
The approval of specific rules can achieve this goal and has a double advantage. On the one hand, it provides updated, rapid and public information on the formation of political parties at European level and their common European status.
Madam President, Commissioners, ladies and gentlemen, the public - especially in the candidate countries - often makes the erroneous assumption that the European Union's Budget deals, in effect, only with agricultural policy.
What I would like to do is to offer a constructive suggestion.
We think that the Member States themselves, for democratic reasons, should have the right to set their own taxes and that the principles of unanimous voting should continue to be used for the consideration of issues by the Council.
It seems to me very clear, for example, that if the rules for entering chat rooms were to be tightened up, by not allowing the use of, for example, Hotmail - I confess I do not know very much about it but it is very easily used - and insisting instead on some sort of traceable e-mail, then the people who do these sorts of things, which they could not do in the open, would be more easily traced.
Written statements and oral questions (tabling): see Minutes
So there is an opportunity to consider this matter in Singapore and at the Dublin European Council meeting in December.

This comes from August of last year, when the Italian elections had not yet been called.
This report met with the unanimous approval of the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy, something on which I should like to congratulate the rapporteur, for it proves that he has managed to separate the main points and subordinate points convincingly.
This is important in order to ascertain the impact of the monetary policy, and, in particular, to ensure that there are no persistent imbalances.
in writing. - Conservatives have voted against this report as it extends the principles of the Prüm initiative into further areas which can be better handled by intergovernmental co-operation rather than harmonisation.
However, I am disappointed that some aspects of the proposal will lead to people who should be involved being excluded.
This partnership will have no future unless it has the benefit of close cooperation with the representatives of the citizens concerned, the associations, the NGOs, the trade unions and civil society as a whole.
Finally, in order to avoid the inevitable scattering in terms of Community programmes, we have to tackle the issue of comitology.
I am thinking in particular of training, consulting and business creation initiatives, which in the framework of the second pillar of the CAP, could still be developed and which would represent the turning point for a significant improvement in living conditions for women, as well as men, in rural areas.
That is 700 new double-hulled oil tankers need to be built incorporating electronic security systems for safe navigation.
There are two further, perhaps rather more political points that I would make.
It requires leadership from every single commissioner and the readiness to turn European Union debates into policy.
In our opinion, the European Union also has an important role to play here.
It is financial considerations - not public ones - which will shape the decision as to how and when an invention is to be exploited and who is to benefit from it, given that control over whether a patented invention is exploited or not is granted to the proprietor of the patent who will naturally make decisions regarding it on the basis of his or her own interests.
This is truly the most idiotic idea at the moment because it means that we would be unable to go any further politically.
It is also an insult to - in this case - the Belgian organisers of this game and the international authorities involved.
Another move forward is the extension of payment terms to 60 instead of 30 days for public health services, which have complex budgetary procedures forcing them to have longer payment terms, for which they cannot be held responsible.
The further transfer of this information to Parliament and its 'competent committee? and 'in accordance with relevant procedures? is vague.
At present, we do not have these items.
It is this matching process which may only take hours but in some cases can take months.
This network operates via national contact points which advise and support local authorities.
I believe the proposal will have enormously harmful effects if it is adopted.
It is not land that is holy but it is man that is holy.
(The President cut the speaker off)
President-in-Office of the Council. - (SL) The European Union is closely following the situation in Burma, or Myanmar.
It is important to seize the opportunity of this debate in order to stand still.
There has unfortunately been very little time to reach compromises or for real debate on some of the issues - hence the large number of amendments.
Therefore, Commissioner, congratulations, we cannot have anything other than appreciation for you in how you have acted.
Member of the Commission. - Mr President, it seems that the majority of Members who took the floor stressed the importance of this European initiative and the real added value of it.
That is not enough, however, and the report recognises it.
I will return to that in a moment.
The number of women living below the poverty line has risen by 50% since the 1970s, while that of men has grown by 30%.
We need to rescue the hungry and vulnerable, support moves to bring political stability, but also respect the various traditions of those five Somali nations so that they can come together through these conferences to live as neighbours in peace and prosperity.
It is high time that these subsidies were phased out gradually down to zero.
That concludes the debate.

On the most important issues, MEAs and eco-labelling, we have laid foundations on which we will build.
I should like to thank the Council for its answer.
I too am disappointed at the available resources, which are in fact inadequate for the role that research and development ought to play in Europe.
What are the institutional implications of this?
My contribution today will refer to an aspect which is not mentioned very much, but which is of particular concern to me when we are talking about Ukraine.
Mr President, before I deal with the individual comments that have been made I should first like to make a general observation that may clear up a few misapprehensions.

it sets specific objectives and confirms Energy Performance Contracting as an instrument for purchasing guaranteed energy savings and a launch pad for creating jobs and reducing European citizens' bills;
There has already been a good deal of debate about these and I have no wish to go over the same ground again.
It was a great achievement on our part to secure an increase in the funding from EUR 54.4 million to EUR 93 million - i.e. it was practically doubled - even though we know that we would need a much larger amount to do justice to the importance of this issue in terms of our common future.
This is a very serious issue.
On that account the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development proposed to this House, and the proposal was accepted, that the project be withdrawn for reconsideration by the Commission.
I would caution Members - insofar as that may be necessary - against a one-sided approach to this whole problem.
When I got to Parliament, however, I looked in the mirror and saw that I was Mr Fatuzzo.

Article 138b of the Treaty on European Union gives Parliament the right to initiate legislation.
It therefore has a protective function if we also take the fingerprints of young people and this is in full accord with all the Conventions that we possess.
The real issue is the violation of fundamental principles with regard to a Member State, which sets a dangerous precedent of arrogance or tyranny.
If we want to make ourselves clear and if we want to stop bandying words and leading Turkey up the garden path, then we should send it a signal which says that, of course, Turkey will not be discriminated against, that goes without saying; however, we need to be clear as to what Turkey' s future within Europe will actually entail.
We Europeans must engage in international politics, whether in the field of foreign policy, where we must work to prevent conflict, or in the sphere of internal security, to which you have referred, where we must play our part in a concerted effort to combat international crime.
(PL) Madam President, in the Communication from the Commission of 23 January 2008 entitled 'Supporting early demonstration of sustainable power generation from fossil fuels', which is part of the climate and energy package, it was stated that the European Union would support the construction of 10 to 12 carbon dioxide capture and storage demonstration plants.
Instead, it is proposing minor, cosmetic changes that retain the regulatory nature of the whole policy.
We are dealing here with a conflict between the humanitarian principle and the principle of national sovereignty, both of which are enshrined in the United Nations Charter, which restricts our means of action.
From a left-wing perspective it must also be emphasised that energy conservation and efficient energy use is a social issue too, given that it is often the poorest people, in particular, that waste the most energy.
My decision was guided by the fact that the final negotiations on the budget, structural policy and agricultural policy should be able to be completed as soon as possible.
Please note this, however: nobody makes loans without conditions, and I am not authorised to do so on behalf of you, on behalf of the Member States.
The second question is: Can you give any details regarding the directive which you intend issuing with a proposal for a longer time limit?
Finally, Commissioner, last weekend, I stumbled over another item that we have not been informed about and that might be relevant for this debate.
Closure, however, does not solve the problem for which the facility was created - and which it too failed to resolve - which is how to deal with a threat to national and international security that is marked by entirely different characteristics from those of traditional enemy combatants, for whom international law was designed and is prepared.
My second remark follows on from what Mr Nassauer said: the Convention puts Parliament, too, in a new position of responsibility.
However, we welcome the fact that the negotiated proposal enables the European Parliament to evaluate and influence the projects.
Also important are the general conditions under which animals are raised, for example, as well as the general conditions under which agriculture operates.
To date, France has agreed to resettle almost 100 refugees on its territory.
Those of us who sit on the Committee on Foreign Affairs, Human Rights, Common Security and Defence Policy take an interest in the equal treatment of the candidate countries, but - as Parliament's fundamental rights are involved - we especially support the position of the Committee on Budgets as well, for budgetary law is the prerogative of any Parliament, and must not be set aside even in a situation such as this.
Madam President, could I suggest to the Commissioner that, not only does the information satisfy lawyers, but it bamboozles consumers?
We are also convinced that partnerships should be strengthened in all the actions taken in this area.
But of course my group will be at one in saying we must resolve this problem as soon as possible so as to give a long-term perspective of how the European Union' s aid is going to be used in MEDA and in CARDS.
(IT) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, we are about to vote on a highly important strategic document that provides a solid framework of reference for financial perspectives after 2013.

This is why, when debating the situation in Chad, we must take into account two interconnected aspects: the internal political aspect and the regional aspect.
Similarly, particular note should be taken in the report of what our committee is calling for, namely for there to be independent committees of inquiry in the event of a shipwreck, so that there cannot be different expediencies in investigating the causes and, of course, something which Parliament has noted for a long time, namely the need for both the Member States and the Commission to take specific action within the International Maritime Organization so that it becomes more active.
What has happened today is deeply troubling.
As President-in-Office of the Council, I can only repeat what I said a moment ago to the honourable Member, namely that this is essentially a matter for the Member States.
This is particularly important.
What will be the role of the local authorities?
And all this is often perpetuated by those in power.
The Cuban dictatorship, however, then summarily sentenced three young men to death for having hijacked a boat - an undeniably serious act - in a trial that was summary and harsh, and which provided no guarantees.
All we do is to keep talking.
We hope that this will happen, so that everyone can benefit.
I hope so, I pray so, I dream so.
The text of the resolution reinforces the idea of an EU policy of double standards in relation to human rights, especially on the issue of human rights violations in the occupied Palestinian territories.

We really must put an end to this hypocrisy: if the European Council and the governments in general are genuinely concerned about the problem of employment then they should give help to those who create jobs, in other words SMEs and micro-enterprises, the necessary means so that they can do this and increase their production and economic growth, something which the whole of Europe needs.
Allow me to use my own country as an example.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, whilst I welcomed the Council and Commission statement, I would like to say immediately that, in the joint motion for a resolution that will be put to the vote tomorrow, I have found an unacceptable paragraph acknowledging the role carried out by Uzbekistan in the fight against international terrorism.
I have written to the Commissioner.

Schmid recommendation (A4-0377/98)
Obsessed as it is by the principles of free competition, the Commission has a tendency to consider services rendered by the public service as pure commodities, without taking into account the social needs to which they are a response, and the specific historical features which have in many cases given rise to them.

We have proposed, and we are implementing, a permanent European Integration Forum, and local government will have a prominent say.
However, since the question is nevertheless such an important part of the Swedish Presidency, I cannot refrain from nonetheless giving the viewpoints of the Swedish Presidency concerning the components that the strategy for sustainable development should include.
The message I would draw from that for our Parliament today is that the leaders attending the summit meeting in Brussels on Friday should now understand clearly that there should be no new roadblocks on the road to enlargement.
This is especially important when we remember that the Singapore conclusions will not be formal agreements but texts containing a political undertaking. These do not require the European Parliament to be formally consulted by the Council, nor is the Luns-Westerterp procedure applicable to them.
Fifthly, economic dependence upon a few products in the economy.
The minimum six-month retention period is broadly applied by telecommunications operators in managing their contracts and their marketing.
That interpretation arises from a confusion of what has been said, which is that the dioxin levels are within EU maximum levels, but the pesticides in food are not, and I gave two instances that were above that.

We must now answer these questions and continue on our current path, both from a domestic and an international perspective.
Mr President, at a time when the European Parliament is deciding on new forms of support for Turkey, we would like to point out that we are amongst those who say that Turkey must be helped and deserves to be helped in its process of transition to full democracy.
A work programme was agreed.
It is now critical that the proposed financial means - and I emphasise this particularly - pass into the right hands.
I do not think it is enough to know that we parliamentarians can telephone JET and ask for information, I think that it should be regulated somewhat better.
If you look at the pre-conditions for liberalization, scarcely anything has been done at European level.
We must therefore engage in serious debate so that ways of managing these rights, which are capable of ensuring transparency, legal certainty and economic efficiency for fishermen, can be assessed.
We really must make the most of the fish that is caught.
Why so?
Mr President, Commissioner, the problem of giving preferential treatment to exports from Israeli settlements in the West Bank and Gaza Strip has now been with us for nearly 30 years and has been the subject of regular oral and written questions and debates in the European Parliament.
We have, of course, worked closely with the Swedish Presidency and I would like once again, both on my own behalf and on behalf of the Commission, to express my thanks for the hard work that I know the Swedish Presidency has put in, including in preparation for what is now to be implemented.
I believe that all the reforms recently implemented by Romania and Bulgaria are testament to these countries’ efforts and to the fact that they give high priority to their membership.
The concept of 'new medicinal product' needs to be better defined, Commissioner.
We should be glad to know about that.
It is also important to combat illegal activities on the Internet.
EU Transcaucasian strategy
This problem did not come out of the blue.

Madam President, President-in-Office of the Council, we ask you not to abandon this objective.
What message can we send to the fishermen of Europe, and their families, and the fishing industries, both the extractive and processing and marketing industries, and the related and secondary industries which depend on fishing in so many European ports, in so many European regions, in most cases peripheral regions, who rightly demand that this problem be dealt with as a priority?
We chose to vote against the first part because we consider that there are differences between the old treaty and the Treaty of Lisbon, for example in the Charter of Rights, which lays down among other things the right to take strike action in accordance with national practice.
And the list goes on.
Keep your distance, listen to the people, not to politicians.
If Turkey maintains it is a European country, a country fit for the European Union, these European values, these Western standards, must be applied there.
Finally, therefore, it is lacking in all the proposals it puts forward.
This would allow too many anomalous projects to slip through.

It is not rational to make a cut in real terms in research in 1999 and the beginning of the next century.
I would like to ask all of us here to speak with one voice, and to speak as strongly as Mr Protasiewicz, who has sent a clear signal to all those fighting for liberty and democracy in Belarus that we are with them, and who has given a clear warning to the regime in Belarus that what they are doing is unacceptable.
Mr President, the truth is that, as has been quite rightly pointed out, we have dedicated two and a half years of work on an important and critical issue which, as we can see, inspires great passion.
I have seen victims of repression, women and men wounded, dying and dead.
The vote will take place at 12 noon.
Instead, the discussion is degenerating into a shabby debate between government leaders who appear only to be interested in sharing out jobs amongst themselves, be it from small or large countries, north, south, east, west, Left or Right, and not whether someone is actually the best candidate to take the responsibilities.
Finally, I would like to take this opportunity to compliment the British Presidency on the work it has done on this subject.

Concentrating on the real problems and problem areas, less bureaucratic structures, and greater efficiency and transparency generally make good sense.
Mrs Lichtenberger is right to say that the blocks are essential for a much more efficient and environmentally friendly sky.
I for my part believe that it is precisely for this reason that the Convention method is a good one and that ample use should again be made of it in the future.
We also need a draft treaty in which non-sustainable energy sources such as nuclear power and fossil fuels are replaced with bio-energy and other renewable energy sources.
The second problem is the Council and, at present, there is no solution to it.
I would also like to thank all the representatives of the Member States who took part, at various levels, in the Intergovernmental Conference.
It is all about power.
I should like to add that in July this year, my services sent out questionnaires to over sixty companies and organisations representing many small and medium-sized enterprises, including both parallel traders and trademark holders, who might be at most risk from abusive restrictions on the sale in the Community of trademarked goods.
The latter could convey certain values and attitudes to Belarus, even if the transmitters are located outside Belarus’ borders, as would be the case under the proposals put forward by the United States.
It is pointless to carry on working and talking about priorities unless we have a budget to back them up.

They are generally held to comprise a minimum range of telecommunications services of a certain quality that can be made available to all users at reasonable prices.
Mr President, I am pleased that both the President-in-Office and Commissioner Verheugen stressed that the Kok report is not an end-point but a starting point for the mid-term review of Lisbon to be concluded at next year's spring summit.
This contribution of a little over 1 % of GDP has enabled us, over the last 50 years, to put an end to the wars that had been ravaging Europe.
Neither is it enough to have a chorus of lamentations: we need on the agenda a programme of ambitious political change for the next ten years.
The level of practical assistance from the Community and from the Member States has been pathetic.
Before we were elected to the European Parliament, many of us simply assumed that the decisions this Parliament took, these decisions that determine the future, were, in fact, based on these data, and we have discovered with a certain amount of dismay that, although these statistics and data exist in most Member States, in reality, they have not yet been brought together into a common framework, and this has therefore given rise to a certain lack of credibility in the eyes of the general public.
Secchi report (A4-0228/98)
Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the rural development policy is the most innovative element of the Community’s new agricultural policy, and it is crucial that the EU budget does not sacrifice this most ambitious of challenges for the future of our rural areas.
But the rapporteur does not really seem to have investigated the causes and the sources of violence in European societies today.
This saying aptly describes relations between numerous neighbouring countries.
President of the Commission. - You have raised many questions.
If, therefore, we wish to have a device, an environmental device, for reducing energy consumption, we must, I am afraid, mainly target households and the transport sector and design a tax instrument in such a way that it particularly affects them.
Wednesday, 5 May 2010:
That is why I appeal to all my colleagues to vote for this report.
Thirdly, the European Union has launched an economic recovery plan to combat the current crisis.
While we could understand that less money is available, we ought then to be saying that we should like to see legislation instead.
We are now under the scrutiny - and rightly so - of the media and, more importantly, through the media, of the people of Europe who expect us not only to have a House that works properly, but one that is seen to work properly.
Finally, we call on the Member States to lay the ground for referenda on potential modifications of the Treaty.
It is already more than twenty years since the United Nations proposed that 0.7% of the GDP should be allocated to development.
I am sorry that there was not time to clear this with all political groups, but I hope that they will support it because it is not trying to change the text.
(Applause)
A programme such as TACIS or any programme can, at most, have an auxiliary role in this direction.
The market is predominantly structured around SMEs, since the range of different applications for biocidal products makes it possible to cater for individual markets.
The Commission and the Council should also take this advice, that it is time we sought to ensure that fish stocks remain, and not just the industry, which will have nothing to fish for in the future if it does not realise that there is a problem.
Of course, we have only achieved this result after complex negotiations with car manufacturers, who have at last agreed to bear the financial burden of scrapping cars as from 2007.
Everything can be found there, including the worst forms of international crime and trafficking in weapons, drugs and human beings.
If ports refuse to turn a ship, swift action is most definitely required.
Mrs Schaffner is showing her approval of this proposal.
In addition, this provision has two major disadvantages.
Our assessment is that serious violations of human rights have continued to occur in the country during 2006.
This instrument makes a very good complement to our policy for requiring other states to support human rights.
The agreement between the PPE-DE Group, the Socialists, the Liberals and the Finnish Presidency takes one more step in the direction of bypassing any opposition and competition, in favour of the prosperity of big business.
That has taken much courage and clarity of thought on both sides, which occasional crises cannot wipe out.
These important political improvements will increase the Union's capacity to achieve its ambitious economic and employment objectives.
Sometimes you have to concede defeat, however painful it may be.
If this Parliament had not made it so clear that enough was enough, I am convinced that the hospital would still be empty now.
The tolls paid by heavy vehicles to use road infrastructures will support, in the long term, the huge investments in the infrastructures included in the European and national economic recovery plans, at the level of both Trans-European transport networks and of other categories of road infrastructures, including mountainous regions where, in many cases, it is particularly difficult to construct roads.
There is also a need for some basic questions to be asked so that agricultural jobs, food safety, the quality of production and the protection of the rural environment remain at the heart of the reform of the CAP.
It will be a very complex instrument and we have to take into account the fact that we have to act within an annual budget.
There is the communication with regard to rescue and restructuring aid and, if agreement is reached - if the Commission gives the green light to a restructuring programme - then there are certain possibilities with regard to subsidies, with regard to state assistance, which would not otherwise be possible.
The French journalists and the two young Italian aid workers who were taken hostage are all innocent in this war, and they risk paying for their commitment to a free Iraq with their lives.
The Commission must once again become what it was originally, namely an administration with a mission, responsible for making proposals to the political authorities of the Council and Parliament and for explaining their choices. It must not represent the beginning of a European government invested with many poorly fulfilled management tasks.
The compromise text agreed with the Council also provides some protection for those immigrants forced to work illegally, who are often held hostage by criminal organisations.
(DE) An amendment suggesting this supplementary formulation is designed to take into account conditions in Scandinavia and has been agreed with the co-rapporteurs and the groups who are also requesting it.
They are difficult for us to accept.
(DE) Madam President, Commissioner, I would like to thank you for your steadfastness when it comes to passenger safety issues.
This is something I refuse to accept.
As an inexhaustible source of energy, biomass also ensures security of supplies, i.e., a certain independence from third countries.
A great many young people have come together in the Danube region this year, and this is a marvellous example of a commitment to tolerance and peaceful social relations.
How does he imagine we are going to replace those several thousand vessels in order that we can continue to provide Europe with its heavy fuel oils?
On the other hand, the register must not, of course, prevent Members from fulfilling their duties arising from their mandate and meeting their constituents or representatives of public bodies on behalf of Member States at the European Parliament.
The compromise package that our rapporteur has negotiated will enable us to pursue the aims of this Directive more successfully.
New opportunities provided by the new technologies must not be wasted, nor should they have, paradoxically, a negative effect as a result of a perverse form of info-exclusion arising from our insensitivity.
The Council has accepted this Letter of Amendment in its entirety and, out of the same concern to act in accordance with the most recent data available, the Council has also accepted the European Parliament' s amendments on rural development expenditure, which demonstrate the progress that has been made in the adoption and implementation of national programmes.
The report of Mrs Kinga Gál summarises the most urgent and most important steps in the development of internal fundamental rights protection.
We hope to achieve this goal by helping the future Member States strengthen their democratic structures and reinforce their economic power.
That is why I support Amendment No 2.
It is the only way forward.
It would be my wish, however, for us to also have referendums, as we have in my home region of Bavaria, at the European level in future.
The question of state ownership must be resolved.
In terms of content, we have achieved all that we set out to achieve.
Mr President, the United Nations declaration adopted in New York two days ago is an important victory for all women.
In particular, I was pleasantly surprised in Bonn by the constructive attitude being taken by the business world.
Take, for example, the Indian cases mentioned in the report.
As has already been mentioned, the pertinent legal standard dates back to 1975, and it is obvious that this directive, like many others, is completely ineffective.
This is an issue which I have consistently brought up in the European Parliament' s Committee on Foreign Affairs, Human Rights, Common Security and Defence Policy, and for which I have found increasing support.
Numerous ways have been found of getting round equal pay.
I must compliment the rapporteur, Mrs Riis-Jørgensen, on the work she has done.
A month before the elections in Ukraine we do not know who will be President.
In this network in particular, which carries approximately half of all goods and passengers, we need to neutralise a dangerous eye-of-the-needle situation.
I should therefore like to call upon Parliament to go with what came out of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs, stated in Mr Herzog’s report, and not to vote in favour of the amendments from the Left.
We are, therefore, taking a great step forward today.
The lack of a soil map and thematic maps results in excessive use of agricultural chemicals.
We have started, but have made very little progress, with Morocco, Egypt and Mauritania.
Mr President, I wish to focus attention on one detail which is often forgotten when terrorism is being spoken about.
The advantages of the euro need to be demonstrated to the public and also to small and medium-sized businesses, precisely because we are having problems at the moment with the acceptance of the euro and it seems to many as though large companies and banks are benefiting from it, but not the man in the street.
It requires a commitment of nation-building, an expression which I use advisedly in this Chamber because the concept of nation-building is something that my country, the United Kingdom, has long experience of, as have France and Spain and some other European countries.
The Commission had indeed supported some new facilities for turbot farming. Even so, given the rapid increase in demand and the relative growth of the industry we believe more assistance is called for.
This framework decision must be seen as a first step in the process of getting to grips with racism and xenophobia at European level and maximum harmonisation in this field.
The EU thus has an opportunity to criticize India not only in word but also in deed.
The Tibet Intergroup is very concerned about the worsening situation in Tibet and it is clear that the current policy of the European Union has proved inadequate to address the grave human rights abuses faced by Tibetans daily in Tibet.
The present statement is therefore a step in the right direction, albeit only the first of what need to be quite a few such steps.
So relations are close, and on both sides there is a strong political will to strengthen them.
I can confirm that Mrs Bonino will be very happy to take part in a debate on the issue in January, and she has also asked me to state very clearly that she hopes the debate will not take place at night.
The real measure is how many problems relating to the application of Community law we have solved, and how quickly.
Attention must therefore be paid to this issue, and it must be taken seriously into consideration.
They are still waiting for Europe to offer proper support to our SMEs, to genuinely plan investments for the future and, above all, to support all those in Europe who are affected by the crisis.
We, therefore, abstained on the following issues: we wanted reform now, not reform later at an uncertain date; we wanted equality for our colleagues from the acceding states.
Mr President, the Community of Europe was born out of a desire to achieve peace and prosperity, a wise and two-fold objective, as it is not possible to achieve one without the other.
We will not agree to women having fewer rights than men, in Europe or elsewhere in the world.
The Commission proposal, as amended in committee, is therefore consistent with the demand of the Committee of Inquiry into BSE for strict separation of animal waste products into those that are basically fit for human consumption and those that come from infected and sick animals.
Even the Commissioner for Employment declared some time ago: 'The right to work in another country is a fundamental freedom for people in the EU'.
Only when they actually sign on the dotted line to this effect will we in the Union be able to help to move the situation on.
This is a must.
Indeed, everyone agrees that only by creating conditions of peace and security across the board can we promote development.
I am pleased to confirm that the Commission has received the report to which the honourable Member refers.
We have to remedy that situation in the course of budgetary trialogue, otherwise our priorities will remain on paper.
On behalf of my group, I want to say that Sylvie Guillaume has prepared - in cooperation, as Mrs Hohlmeier said, with all the shadows - a proposal which is both sensitive and effective, and really provides, as the Commissioner said, a cornerstone of the asylum package.
The differences of opinion on the main problem were clear.
We know from surveys that before 1993 compliance with customs controls was costing traders some ECU 7.5 billion every year - that is based on 1992 trade levels but expressed in today's money.
We could, of course, also offer incentives here such as their reintegration into the OSCE.
The Europe of results must take into account the expectations of citizens and show itself to be a solution, not a problem.
In that respect this Parliament too has much to gain and learn from such an approach.
How can you accept that what was allowed at the time of the decision postponing the implementation of the euro should be refused at the time of the decision - fundamental for the countries of the European Union - on its implementation properly speaking?
France, which already uses this clause on its northern borders, has considerably strengthened controls along its borders with Italy, without even attempting to invoke the legal cover of the safeguard clause.
However, solutions must be tailored to the type of bullying involved, which can be gender-specific, age-specific or racist.
It is a question about the order, but I do not believe that the Council needs incentives from MEPs to speak if it wishes.
The White Papers that discuss the energy matters of the Union and its Member States have repeatedly demanded clean, independent and competitive forms of energy - but there is only a functioning market mechanism for the last criterion, competitiveness.
What is the relationship between philosophy and theology according to all these different points of view?
Accordingly, a precedent is set and the use of all of the official languages is put at risk.
It has consequences for the common market and the economic situation of both parties, i.e. that of the maintenance creditor and that of the debtor.
The final selection of candidates is made by the portfolio Commissioner, by myself as the Commissioner for Personnel Administration, and the President.
It is perhaps long overdue, but certainly welcome.
But our work should be serious, responsible and punctual, and if we are unable to make progress on a specific matter at a certain time, we should explain why that is, or why we think we have to resort to a Green Paper.
It seems to me that the operation and existence of the third pillar shows unambiguously that of the four fundamental freedoms that this Community is supposed to be based on, the freedom of movement of persons is the lesser one, even in a Union that does not tire of telling us that we now live in a citizens' Europe.
I think that the Macedonian model, where the European Union has been able to deploy all its diplomatic, financial and military capabilities, can be an example worthy of imitation in many countries of the world.
The Commission needs to come up with initiatives for the transport, farming and energy sectors.
And most important of all, we also need to have easier access not only to credit, but also to drawdowns of financial resources from European funds.
Parliament drew up a resolution on this programme and the Conference of Presidents spent long weeks and long months in negotiations with the Commission, in which officials and one of the Commissioners appointed by the Commission were also involved.
We have made progress across a range of issues.
In the past, we held negotiations with countries which are now Member States of the European Union, and now we are holding negotiations with countries which would like to join the European Union: the approach must be equal - it must be absolutely the same for everybody.
We must also allow more regions to receive assistance by introducing a lower deployment ceiling.
In response to these problems, the proposal for a directive provides for administrative procedures to be simplified as much as possible, for example, by limiting the obligation for prior authorisation of treatment by the national healthcare body, and by ensuring better exchange of information on medical services in other countries by setting up national contact points.
Subject: Cuba and the Helms-Burton Act
Firstly, children and the rights of children too often are seen as separate from what should be family policy.
You beat me by two years.
I hereby declare that I did not raise such a demand, either for Germany or for any other country for that matter.
In Serbia, thanks to the determination of the Serbian people, democracy is on the point of asserting itself.
The removal of Member States' ability to set an upper level on the amount of outstanding pay claims to be guaranteed would go well beyond the aim of providing a minimum standard of protection to safeguard the vulnerable.
What has become of the EU' s ambitions for an independent foreign policy?
In any case, the European option in crisis management is to appeal first to the will and action of regional and international organisations; in other words, dialogue takes priority.
In this area, decisions lack courage, laws are thin on the ground and support is virtually non-existent.
However, we need to be able to take decisions.
In its work, Parliament relies heavily on the Court of Auditors' annual report and its special report.
From now on I will confine myself to answering the very specific questions that have been raised.
Since the fiasco with the euro rescue package, the net contributors have been asked to pay up two and three times over.
So we must also set measures in train to create easier access to risk capital and new, hybrid forms of financing.
9. An EU-South Africa Strategic Partnership (vote)
Treatment is expensive and it is not accessible to all, especially in the new EU Member Countries.
Bearing in mind the climate change we are facing, I support the introduction of instruments for monitoring the environmental factors in each region separately, along with the allocation of an adequate budget for this.
All too often the cries of those people whose economy depended on tourists and whose contribution to the economy was worth six times that of the farmers went totally unheeded.
I should especially like to thank Mrs Gröner, the rapporteur for the programme, as well as the Committee on Culture and Education, which dealt with matters in a very constructive manner during the procedure.
The Council will have to take the appropriate decisions, of course, in a climate of cooperation, but naturally with the greatest respect for the principles and rules laid down in the Treaties and in the regulations in force in the field of budgetary stability.
That was not always the attitude when I lodged amendments to that effect a year ago, but the groups seem to have come round to that.
Sixth Community Environment Action Programme
Up until a few years ago, Parliament gave tangible assistance and funding to schools and schoolchildren throughout Europe, but then, in order to save money, this funding was stopped.
It is clear that we urgently need positive development among this minority, but this is something which both the authorities and the Roma community itself are responsible for.
The Irish Government themselves have ignored the mandate that they clearly got from the people.
Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, this year, we are not only celebrating the 20th anniversary of the fall of the Wall and the peaceful revolution, but 1989 was also the year that saw the death of Andrei Sakharov, who played a significant part in the fall of the totalitarian Eastern Bloc system.
I would like to make tangible progress quickly on the issue of concessions, without waiting for this long-term work on modernising the public procurement framework to be completed.
in writing. - (LT) Europe is going through a difficult period caused by the global economic crisis, the recovery is still fragile and Member States are paying a different price to overcome the crisis.
Subject to successful sea trials we believe that scrubbing can indeed be considered as an alternative to low-sulphur fuels and not just for the proposed second-phase limit of 0.5%.
Here again, I am referring to what Ban Ki-moon was saying to us this morning.
Telephone networks and television channels are the prime users of space technologies, but a great many services based on satellite facilities are also provided to other sectors such as transport, agriculture, fisheries, protection of natural resources, and others.
Within this theology a number of extraordinarily adventurous tactics were deployed.
Commissioner, I hope that this intolerable practice by Morocco will not be repeated in the future, since it would jeopardise the achievements of the fisheries agreement with Mauritania.
The draft gives opportunities for higher penalties, defining a minimum for maximum penalties, encouraging seizing and confiscating the proceeds and assets resulting from trafficking.
I shall then, with your participation, if you are willing, devote my attention to conducting the dialogue on European issues - and the future and the place of the outermost regions form part of these issues.
But it also represents a possibility to start something new, the possibility to support the fantastic new democratic forces that are emerging: there is a great willingness to reform countries, especially in Tunisia but also in Egypt.
For this reason they only accepted the slightest and most miserly alterations to Category 3 (Internal Policies) and Category 5 (Administrative Expenditure).
When the time came for me to give our instructions I received 26 emails on the same day saying that Commissioner Liikanen’s website did not meet the agreed conditions.
What will Europe be like in the coming years, in the six or fifteen years to come?
With regard to the carriage of dangerous materials by road, there is a huge lack of training, a major shortage of equipment in terms of parking areas that can safely take the vehicles concerned in accordance with Community regulations.
Furthermore, the issue of the settlements and the controversial status of East Jerusalem are not directly related to the humanitarian crisis in the Palestinian territories.
No farmer uses pesticides for fun - after all, they are expensive.
This exercise gives the Foundation helpful lessons and recommendations with regard to the challenges facing its future programming phase.
In this respect, the Commission welcomes the resolution on Korea voted by Parliament in December 2007.
I think many of us still have concerns about the legality - and there has been much spoken about this either at WTO level or within our own internal market rules.
I should again like to extend my heartfelt thanks to the European Parliament for the major role that it has played in bringing about this result.
Our own services - and even some of our committees - pay scant attention to the work of the Committee on Petitions.
Furthermore, in the previous year various studies were financed, including a study on the protection of young athletes.
We must be able to implement a decision-making system that aims at better and more credible security.
Let us remember that EMAS is a voluntary market instrument. Let us remember also that one of the main objectives of the current revision of the regulations is to make the system more accessible to small and medium-sized businesses and also the service sector.
However, I think that the approach adopted in the report, of putting Europol under the supervision of a Commissioner and thus under the supervision of the European Parliament, is the wrong one.
That is already happening, certainly in Ireland.
British government, Commission, Council, European Parliament, same battle.
The vote will take place tomorrow at 12 noon.

The composition of the import rules, too, which were intended to further the marketing of banana products from the EC and ACP states, were not considered to be in accordance with WTO regulations, as were aspects of our agreement with the most important countries of origin which were part of the agriculture chapter in the Uruguay Round.
That is precisely why we have a valuable culture of consensus in the Council of Ministers.
Mr Orbán was not involved in this at the beginning.
Clearly the debate on state aid focuses primarily on so-called public service broadcasters, as defined by each Member State, given the basically minimal resources which they have at their disposal and, above all, the important public service role allocated to them.
That begs the question, then, of why it wants to strengthen its powers if it does not make use of them.
What specific negotiating action could the Commission undertake in this connection, to give some satisfaction to consumers?
Turning to the current situation, I should like to repeat that the monetary policy strategy of the Eurosystem, which has been made very clear to Parliament, is based on two pillars, both designed to be forward-looking over the medium-term.
She needs to have access to asylum seekers to ensure that anyone who wants to apply for asylum can do so and that their applications are examined carefully.
The mention made of the crimes of Saddam Hussein's regime would be acceptable if sincere and if this were not done while ignoring the current crimes and their perpetrators which have resulted in hundreds of thousands of deaths and millions of displaced persons.
Just make sure that now and then the poor people in the UK hear the truth, as they rarely receive correct information.
This is an environmental issue.

At the same time, the report also presents a realistic and detailed picture of the demanding tasks which Croatia, as a candidate country, yet has to implement on its road to accession. Amongst these tasks the report mentions Croatia's unresolved issues with its neighbouring countries.

on behalf of the PSE Group. - (DE) Mr President, I should like to address three aspects.
It is important to note that international efforts can and do make a difference.
One such problem relates to the need to provide greater childcare facilities for women who take up jobs in rural parts of my country and indeed, throughout Europe.
What are we afraid of?
The written text of a treaty is not enough.

The social security systems of our twenty-five states were forged at different stages of history, and resulted from very different social struggles involving trade unionists and politicians.

Private enterprise in Belarus cannot function efficiently, and the effects of the Chernobyl disaster are still of grave concern.
Congratulations, Jean-Claude Juncker!
Where the environment is concerned, it has been possible to accomplish major progress thanks to the entry into force of the Kyoto Protocol, the Water Framework Directive and the directive on waste reduction and recycling.By preparing a genuine common policy on asylum and immigration and stepping up the fight against crime at Community level, progress has been made in promoting freedom of movement and establishment within the EU.
I am in favour of the state knowing what processes are taking place and therefore, in terms of providing accounts, I still believe that it is very important to simplify those accounts, but in such a way that we do not violate the elementary requirements for transparency and company principles.
(SV) Mr President, our media are currently full of all the cuts and savings that need to be made for countries to be able to manage the debts that have been inflicted upon the people.
First he assures us that no part of the CAP budget will be used for Kosovo or for exercising the European Union' s foreign policy and then he says that, in any case, the Commission has said - and rightly so - that any sums not taken up will be shared out.
This is how matters stand with regard to MEDA: Malta and Cyprus can take part in the national programmes, but not in the country-specific ones, because the incomes are too high.
There are four areas I would like to touch on briefly.
Israel must be protected, but the policy of everyone in that region, including the Israeli Government, must be reviewed.

In fact the EU waited until NATO took responsibility for the matter.
Nearly half a million calves were exported from Britain to the rest of Europe in 1995 and that must deliver a message in itself.
Is this agency merely Europe's umpteenth smart gadget, or is it the key to the proper functioning of the democracies in the Union?
Indeed, we had a very earnest and also very self-critical debate about the quality of European lawmaking and the application of the principle of subsidiarity.
The left is in favour of freezing assets, of the arms embargo, of fostering a relationship with the uprising, and of all humanitarian aid measures, but I would also like to make it clear that we are against any form of military intervention, including the measure that might open the door to such intervention: the no-fly zone.
The other two, in this case environmental and social development, will have to await their turn for President Barroso’s attention.
The presidency is looking forward to the Court's forthcoming special report on the functioning of UCLAF.
The upward revaluation of the koruna by more than 17% is certainly economically justified.
The European Parliament considers that the common principles on airport charges should only apply to airports with over five million passenger movements per year, or to those at which annual traffic amounts to over 15% of the number of passenger movements in the Member State in question.
The broad guidelines relate well to the agreements reached at Lisbon.
I would also back this compromise that has been reached if, under the leadership either of the rapporteur or of a delegation from the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs, it were to be introduced into plenary immediately following negotiations with the Commission.
I must say, in all honesty, that I only have to think of the ignorance and squirming with which the Agriculture Council has reacted to proposals over recent months, including Parliament's proposals, to lose all confidence in information provided by Member States and ministers.
It is perhaps the committee in this House that is most in touch with our citizens.
I appeal to the Commission and the Presidency of the Council, as a matter of urgency, to face up to their responsibility for this legal draft, and to join us in making things simpler and cutting back bureaucracy.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, it is interesting to hear certain reconstructions of the facts which - quite rightly - merely skim the surface of the present, while totally overlooking or pretending to overlook the past, the Taliban past, or, as in other contexts, while criticising the actions which may lead to war in Iraq and forgetting the thousands, the hundreds of thousands of people massacred, tortured and exterminated under Saddam Hussein's regime.
As someone from one of the eastern European countries waiting to join the euro zone, I would like to make only four brief remarks:
We must support their demands.
The total number of SMEs targeted by these measures is negligible compared with the total number of SMEs in the ÅU: 7 387 out of a total of some 15 million SMEs in the ÅU or 0.05% of the total number over a period of two years from application.
But I am glad to say that it represents a real increase of around 10 % and is fully consistent with the lower ceiling for internal policies that was agreed at the Berlin Summit.
However, the problem with it, of course, is that it completely skates over what are the real problems in the European economy, and I am puzzled that no questions at all are asked as to why things are really going so badly.
There is, though, a new regulation for those holders of the national visa issued by the Member States for longer-term residence who are not yet in possession of the residence permit.
That is precisely the effect we intend competition to have.
These are much needed measures that follow up the proposal contained in the Water Framework Directive and will help to end the chemical pollution of water, which disturbs aquatic ecosystems, causes biodiversity to be lost and makes human beings increasingly exposed to pollutants.
A higher level of vulnerability is being witnessed in rural areas where, in countries like Romania, poverty, unemployment, starting work at an early age and dropping out of school are ruining the futures of countless children and young people.
One thousand five hundred texts!
Mr President, waste is a major problem throughout the European Union.
We voted against the report, despite its individual positive points, because it accepts the mid-term review for olive oil as a foregoing conclusion.
I imagine that it is for a point of order.
Mr President, at this time of looming budget crises and an increasingly depressing outlook for the Hong Kong talks, I would like to bring to the attention of the House an EU success story.
That may help to break the logjam we are facing there.
But we also have considerable deficits.
First of all, I should like to thank the rapporteurs for the serious work that has gone into the reports.
I do of course endorse the material need for dialogue between the European Union and Iran.
In comparison with this, and in spite of the advised favourable growth environment, the draft European Union budget allows for an increase of just 5.4% compared to 2003, which means that the year on year growth in funds paid out should be 30% lower than in 2004.
These texts are the fruit of several months’ discussions and hearings in the Committee on Agriculture and of exchanges of views with yourself, Commissioner, with your services and with the various parties concerned in the industry.

It was recognised that the provision of appropriate and accessible child care was a priority matter, so as to allow young parents to continue in paid employment.
In the case of Bosnia, it is important to build state structures and promote cooperation with the war crimes tribunals. In relation to Croatia, the importance of national minorities and cooperation with them should be stressed.
This should include everything of relevance to the consumer.

I shall therefore be voting for Mr Martin's report, and I do so in the hope that producers in all wine-growing areas will be spared any further rules and regulations in future.
I am therefore promoting the creation of a code of ethics for retailers and producers of video games.
This we still do not know.
We support Mr Desama, apart from two issues on which my group has tabled amendments.
Nevertheless, the government must not now give in to the KLA' s demands so as to avoid civil war; instead it must take account of the long-standing demands of the elected Albanians in Macedonia and seek solutions with them.
It is unreasonable to have such a rigid budget model that the tightest budget margins are in precisely those areas where the needs are greatest.
It is an important partnership agreement, cofinanced by Europe and Israel as part of the fourth research framework programme.
Finally, I would just like to add that it is very good that the European Union is speaking out on matters concerning citizens' freedoms.
We improve efficiency and we strengthen the role of this Parliament, guaranteeing the principle of democratic legitimacy, which is fundamental for the adoption of legislation on topics as sensitive as asylum and immigration policy and others that involve people’s fundamental rights.
The third and most important point is that the penalties for those who break the rules have been increased to a fine of € 14 000, two years imprisonment and the permanent confiscation of hunting licences for repeat offenders; in other words, the second time round they are shown the red flag and sent off.

We too would like to see an ecological audit of Parliament's buildings.
Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I would also like to start by expressing my warm thanks to the rapporteur, Mrs McCarthy, and our shadow rapporteur.

It includes a recital in which the Agriculture Committee is cautiously in favour of that cofinancing, but there was a tied vote on whether or not to include an article on this.
It is not enough for inspections to be carried out when the products are already in the shops; they must be made beforehand.
These are highlighted very obviously in Mr Casa's report.
I emphasize, however, that it is not a question of diverting existing resources.
To begin with, the bank' s operational priorities.
We therefore repeat the demand for inquiries and visits to East Timor, which Indonesia has refused this House since November 1991.
But we must be realistic, and we are clearly not yet on that level at the present time, because we do not have a foundation of shared values - human rights, fair treatment of minorities, rejection of the death penalty - on which a genuine strategic partnership could be built.
In Europe it is very difficult to combine studies with sport and this means that our young people eventually have to choose between the two.
It is, in fact, absolutely right to say that intelligent traffic systems, intelligent traffic management systems, cutting-edge, innovative solutions for the personal and mass transit of the future must be found and that this crisis perhaps offers an opportunity to push such solutions forward more strongly.
A week further down the line and two cases of BSE have come to light in Germany.
(The President interrupted the speaker)
That has happened in the past in the case of Slovakia.

Recent newspaper reports have indicated Egypt may be willing to lift the ban in the near future after an intense lobbying campaign by Irish officials.
I hope that the United Nations world summit on the information society will contribute to the public debate on the sort of information society we want.
We can write the finest speeches and adopt the finest policies, but if our people and our students refuse to cooperate, then I fear, Commissioner, that these words will not be translated into action.

However dark and uncertain the future may be, we must stand firm behind the USA as that noble country did for us in our darkest hour.
draftsman of the opinion of the Committee on Transport and Tourism. - (DE) Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, essentially, I can only agree with the statements by the rapporteur, Mrs Haug.
In that selfsame year, OLAF, the anti-fraud office, completed 652 inquiries, involving a total loss of EUR 937 million.

Madam President, Commissioner, I would firstly like to warmly congratulate Mrs Roth-Behrendt on having made progress on this difficult directive and particularly on the manner in which she has done so.
What we need is a different way of organizing society, a different way of organizing working hours.
In the very few minutes available to me I should like to recall a number of aspects that are of the greatest political significance: first, an appeal for a general effort to support political pluralism.
There is no legal certainty in the area of risk assessment for exposure to solar radiation in the workplace, and it is a legal certainty that in a litigious age it will end up as a lawyers' charter, and nothing else.
It is in Turkey that an Islamic government is engaged in establishing our western values on firm foundations; it was at that government that the attacks in Istanbul – to which Mr Poettering referred – were aimed.

The modifications requested by Parliament's rapporteur will all lead to a deterioration in workers' terms and conditions.

I welcome his call to allow judicial authorities to speak to each other without diplomatic protocol.
I should like to inform the House that I have just received a letter from the chairman of the Committee on the Rules of Procedure, containing the interpretation to which I referred during our debate on the order of business.
Should we take the view that this sector is now positively thriving?
I shall close by emphasising that, despite the permanent nature of the specific characteristics that justify the special treatment granted to the outermost regions by Article 299(2), these tax measures are not only limited in terms of time - they are valid for seven years - but are also limited in quantitative terms.
If we do it with a lot of stars, people will say it is only propaganda.
We carry on down the same path, albeit perhaps not at such speed.
The amendments that have been adopted, therefore, cover some essential aspects of mobility and seek to improve or eliminate administrative, financial or social difficulties.
I therefore believe that the text obtained is inconsistent and contradictory on certain points, such as the funding of research into embryonic stem cells or into the use of surplus embryos.
Mr President, reference has already been made to the way in which President Mobutu's regime embezzled funds from development cooperation budgets and other sources.
Let us therefore press for sound consultations from now until Thursday, so that we can reach a voting result that is consistent at all levels and is widely supported, because a widely supported voting result will also culminate in a balanced legal document.
The same can be said of the Community financial contribution towards expenditure incurred by the Member States in implementing control systems, as governed by Decision 95/527.
As the question undeniably is of more than national significance I believe it would be reasonable for the Commission to take an active interest in these issues.
These are required because such regulations would allow for a more accurate adaptation of the general stipulations of the Framework Directive to specific situations.
If they do not let go of this attitude, little will change, despite the Convention and despite Mr Solana's interesting document.
We have no reservations whatsoever in this regard.
If you look at the composition of the Romanian parliament and government now, you will find a large number of young politicians who were initially given assistance in their capacity of members of unions or associations and now hold important political offices and also form part of the Romanian political elite.
As the last speaker, I hope that the Commission and the Council obey the evangelical maxim when it comes to paying attention and that the last are put first, not only in the Kingdom of Heaven, but also here in Parliament.
However in all, more of the e-mail complaints are directed against authorities of Member States.
We should remember that the issue is not restricted to farm animals, but also extends to experimental, zoo, circus and wild animals.

You said this morning that you would endorse Amendment No 19 at today 's vote.
It seems to me that something of a credibility gap is developing here, one that may cause a great deal of damage in days to come.
I believe Parliament must contribute to making this strategy stronger and more coherent.
We call for the list of those who are banned from entering the EU to be significantly extended.
Of course, Mrs McNally, we shall certainly be holding this debate with the Commission in December, but we cannot really blame the commissioners in question for not being able to come back any earlier.
Therefore, it is up to us to show how Europe is going to protect them on concrete issues.
However, we must set these targets beyond 2010.
We have tried to find a solution through the OECD agreement, at a global level, and we have not disarmed on a unilateral basis.
Is it not reasonable for you, as the people with responsibility, to call upon your employees, or even order them, to appear for questioning so that financial crime that has taken place within the Commission' s area of responsibility might be investigated?
The results of the audit did not identify any serious irregularities.
However, we will see that problems will arise when it comes to details.
These are the solutions provided, and we cannot rely on external suppliers which unfortunately do not honour their contractual obligations and do not take into account consumer interests.
Puzzlingly, British courts seem shy of invoking this clause to block surrender.
The proposal to appoint a High Official on Foreign Energy Policy is very appropriate and deserves further consideration.
The reform, which is required, must enable small producers to benefit from a more favourable system of aid.
It is not a matter of repudiating the magnificent work done so far, and which has served our purpose so well, but this should be complemented by other, more suitable methods.
At the moment, we are facing many challenges in the field of foreign policy, such as the conflicts in the Middle East, military missions involving soldiers of the Member States and the emergence of new world powers such as China or India.
On Monday evening, 10 January, Ukraine’s central election committee officially declared Viktor Yushchenko to be winner of the presidential elections and with this, a stunning fact became reality for the West and East alike.
What does the Minister have to say about that?
This is what matters most; it means that Europe's lack of knowledge compared to the United States is only growing.
Mr President, I should add that an agreement was signed under the auspices of the United Nations and its Secretary-General in May of this year, precisely in order to conduct a serious consultation with the people of Timor.
Instead, we must act without delay.
Our efforts can alleviate the humanitarian crisis for the Palestinians.
I would, however like to say that I am the deputy chairman of this committee and I was treated in exactly the same manner.

It is clear that, at this point, the three processes have to be combined.
We used the Altmark package to simplify and clarify the rules on state aid relating to services of general interest.
I believe that the measures we are discussing represent a serious attempt to face up to an unavoidable problem - the risk that the Commission will end up overwhelmed by notifications - and I think it was both right and courageous to choose to base this reform on decentralisation to national authorities and courts.
Let us say frankly that the situation is least transparent with the finances of the Council.
The entry into force of this directive must be based on the guarantee of an internal market that is as viable as possible without any risk of distortions.

For these reasons, I support the decision to open the borders to these Member States.
This is a European crisis that must be tackled from a European perspective, with ambition and by using all available Community tools, something which the Commission at the moment seems incapable of doing.
The Russian people today are no more responsible for Stalin’s crimes than are the German people for Hitler’s.
In any case, these EUR 280 million are not part of the Dairy Fund, but rather we are talking about a one-off intervention.
The issue is whether the whole Council is determined, and if we are all determined for that matter, to meet the challenges of these difficult times of heavy competition and internationalisation, and to respond to all the problems, including Third World development, where the support of Europe is vital. We also need to ensure the success of enlargement which can only be made possible, Madam President, if we increase our existing pool of resources.
Why, in fact, do we put up with a state of affairs in which the only ones that get talked about are France and the Netherlands?
– Mr President, Commissioner, as rapporteur on the discharge for the European Development Funds, I wish to start by saying that these funds are an important and valuable tool for promoting solidarity, prosperity in the world, peace, the principles of justice and respect for human rights.
Apart from agriculture, this is also an issue in, for example, the textile and clothing sector, where the complete opening up of the Community market to products from the former group of countries would destroy hundreds of thousands of jobs in the European Union, especially in the poorest countries and those lagging furthest behind, such as Portugal, Greece, Spain and the new Member States in Eastern Europe.
Fortunately, the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Protection has made adequate amendments to the proposal, which will have my vote.
I am sure that all of them will, during the course of the next five years, look back with gratitude and respect at the legacy which you, Mr President, have left this institution.
Nigeria is not the only country in the world in which such cruelties take place.
Mr President. Non-governmental environmental protection organizations play a particularly important role in Europe.
Without an appropriate amount of good-quality soil, European agriculture too will be jeopardised.
Everyone is aware that what Parliament is asking for is an investigatory committee on the , precisely in order to clarify what has happened and to avoid repetition, in order to establish that seriously damaged vessels should not be sent to the open seas to sink, but that ports of refuge should be provided.
That concludes the explanations of vote.
We are not doing anything whatsoever about it.
We have only to think about the reasons for annulling a marriage and for divorce and the conditions of marriage and divorce.
That is a shame.
Subject: EU policy on APMs in the aftermath of the Conference of Ottawa
In the global work to promote peace, disarmament and human rights, we wish however to prioritise the UN, which is better suited than the EU to carrying out such tasks.
Mr President, the Committee on Research, Technological Development and Energy considers it essential for the European Union to draw up a policy aimed, on the one hand, at guaranteeing and promoting the cultural and linguistic diversity of the Union in the information society and, on the other, transforming the obvious advantages of the Union at the level of knowledge and experience of multilingualism into new economic and job-creating opportunities.
If the Research Council, the programmes, and that on which we are to vote tomorrow help to bring us closer to that, then we in this House will all have done a good piece of work.
It is of particular concern to us that a subject such as this, with extremely serious consequences and ethical dimensions, is mainly approached from the standpoint of economics and commerce.
Jean Monnet said before this Parliament: "Nous nʼavons que le choix entre les changements dans lesquels nous serons entrainés et ceux que nous aurons su vouloir et accomplir' .
In an increasingly multipolar world, we have entered into strategic partnerships with our most important partners.
We believe that cooperation is certainly feasible, indeed we believe that such cooperation is actually necessary for bringing about policy that will truly promote peace and development.
It must be understood that we incline more to the approach advocated by Mr Pirker.
I wonder whether the Commissioner would be prepared to consider that?
The visa liberalisation is an excellent step to demonstrate to the people in the western Balkans that they move in the right direction.
I am thinking of sectors like shipbuilding, the motor industry, iron and steel and textiles, all areas in serious crisis and needing to achieve social and economic cohesion even earlier than the rest.
Mr President, as you rightly said, the question does exist, and it is not just a question of terminology.
That is why, Commissioner, I would urge you to encourage the government to continue its process of reform.
The Council on Monday strongly encouraged the parties to take the first steps to end this devastating and self-fuelling cycle of violence that we have seen over the last 14 months.
This is a breach of European and international law.
The agricultural sector has to be a priority, and we must strengthen the country's agricultural production capacities.
We are not imposing nutrient profiles on anyone.
The commitments in terms of competitiveness, public finances and pensions, employment and so on must be translated into the national reform and stability programmes.
We need to start to get some agreement internationally to stop this subsidy and this depletion of stocks in the world's oceans.
The pressure to maximise extraction does not go hand-in-hand with measures intended to improve safety or with proper risk assessment.
It must be possible for it to be a positive choice, and in that case mobility should not have to face all sorts of obstacles with regard to consistency between social security systems and taxation systems, double taxation, and the recognition of qualifications etc.
In the future, if not in the short term, there will be shorter working hours, as history shows.
Ahead of the 2010 United Nations Climate Change conference in Cancún, what concrete measures is the Council taking to coordinate the EU's position at the negotiations, with the emphasis on the whole EU speaking with one voice?
We ourselves protected our industries until they were strong enough to compete internationally.
At the same time, I will be speaking as a representative of my group and therefore I will take account of its political priorities.
As a result, the recommendation for second reading proposes that the amendments which approximate to the position and spirit of the amendments adopted by Parliament in part-session should be reinstated.
These observations were what finally influenced my decision and what led to Commissioner van den Broek's commitment to suspend the partnership agreement should human rights violations continue, as provided for in Article 2 of the Partnership and Cooperation Agreement.
That, sadly, is just the way things are.
.
The growth of the 'eco-industry' also offers a positive outlook, particularly in terms of employment.
That is the position, Madam, as I am sure you know.
Firstly, it should be extended to cover all decisions with an environmental impact, not just those decisions that are taken on the basis of Article 175 of the Treaty.
Just for the sake of clarity, if you vote against this, you are supporting the measure that enables interception at sea.
The creation of a European Fund for refugees, which the European Parliament has just adopted, despite the Union for a Europe of Nations Group' s voting against it, provides a fine example of these hypocritical proposals which will solve nothing at grass-roots level and will serve only to make the situation worse by transferring costly and unsupervised jurisdiction to Europe.
Ladies and gentlemen, the market for products obtained through genetic engineering, which is developing very rapidly at a world level, presents two major problems.
The aid which we provide in this area often goes unnoticed.
The banana controversy is a good example of how hard it is to reconcile the interests of the fifteen Member States, the Union, the ACP banana producing countries, European consumers and our trading partners.
Those are three important principles in an excellent report.
I therefore believe that things are moving forward, that progress is being made, but I also see the difficulties that exist when it comes to convincing the Member States to take concrete measures.
(Applause)
For the sake of clarity, I wish to deal with each amendment in turn.
What underlies these reasons?
However, for one fallen wall, how many others have been erected on our continent?
(PL) Mr President, Commissioners, cohesion policy should be maintained and strengthened in the new financial framework.
As I pointed out in my previous replies to questions on the same subject, the Council entirely shares the honourable Member' s concern about the disastrous position in which large sections of the Afghan population now find themselves, and in particular the disastrous position of women and children.
I have just been talking to an expert on internal security from Europol.
However, please learn from the events of Seattle: we have to be able to combine the freedom in world trade, on the one hand, with all those values of human importance that we wish to defend, on the other.
Two years ago we were already sounding warnings to the effect that the WTO would mean less democratic control by parliaments and citizens.
I only wish my own country, Scotland, could take its natural place as a constructive and enthusiastic partner Member State, but we are on our way, for we do have much in common.
In my opinion, the European Year of Equal Opportunities for All offers an appropriate framework for that.
I am thinking, for example, of Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease but also many other lesser known, but just as dreadful, diseases.
What we want Parliament to do is to shorten this to what is known as 'key investor information' or a document with essential information for investors of the kind provided by traditional investment funds, the UCITS.
Whilst we understand the reasons why the report was moved and are in favour of being as helpful as we can, we would ask the rapporteur if she would consider moving the report to July so that it can be dealt with when the Commissioner is available.
The next item is the debate on the following six motions for resolution on Nigeria, and more specifically the case of Mrs Amina Lawal:
And it can be checked by the courts.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, as I highlighted in my address to Parliament's Committee on Employment and Social Affairs last July, the Commission is very happy with the particular attention granted by Parliament to this report, which has been discussed within three parliamentary committees, the Committee on Women's Rights, the Committee on Culture, Youth, Education and the Media, and the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs, which has been the lead committee.
One is a proposal I know a lot about - the Services Directive.
The essential premise for the success of such cooperation is for all the competition authorities to apply the Community rules more widely, otherwise the planned network would just be an empty framework.
The central banks work on the assumption that in practice inflation rates of less than 2 % produce price stability.
I very much regret that the PPE-DE Group has not seen fit to advocate this system with the vigour and commitment that are needed to give consumers and the public at large real confidence in the European Union and the internal market, for such confidence comes from knowing that they are properly protected when they go shopping in Europe.
As I see it, the gap is now becoming well and truly bridged.
We should also make it perfectly clear that we regard, in the European Union, it as important that the people and the country of Slovakia should ultimately achieve their rightful place inside the European Union.
The 'Small Business Act' is aimed at increasing entrepreneurship in Europe and helping businesses grow.
For instance, there are Turkish troops in many countries in the Balkans, and even in the 'European army', as one British newspaper recently dubbed the 'Althea' operation in Bosnia.
The Committee on Agriculture did not face up to the realities.
(The sitting was closed at 7.35 p.m.)
Let me repeat: we did not start working on this just today; we have been working on these issues for the last four years.
Mr President, Commissioner, I must say you are right.
By introducing these elements, we have managed to moderate both proactive tendencies and the zeal for liberalisation.
Our daily food intake is being taken over by pharmacists, chemists and genetic engineers.
Commissioner, the gas crisis in January certainly had one positive outcome.
It is therefore very important to get the Stability and Growth Pact back on the rails and to enable the Commission to make constructive proposals.
Mr President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, Commissioner, on 26 September 2009, 44 citizens' panels were organised in 38 countries representing the various stages of development.
(The sitting was suspended at 11.15 for voting time, and resumed at 11.30)
At the time of our previous resolutions on that same issue, which were adopted in 2002 and 2003, the Commission told us that it would examine the issue of Taiwan’s participating in the work of the WHO, in particular through non-State channels, via an NGO for example.
We in the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance are of course in favour of supporting the process of democratisation in Congo.
The Conference of Presidents has asked me to make a statement on the Middle East.
During the meeting in Geneva recently of the UN Commission on Human Rights, we had the opportunity to speak to a Texan attorney who opposed the death penalty.
Mr President, today's proposal for the adoption by the European Parliament of the common position on the decision to implement a programme of support for the European audiovisual sector is due, I would say, to the personal persistence and systematic work of a great many people, especially the rapporteur, Mrs Ruth Hieronymi, whom I too, as draftsman of the opinion of the Committee on Women's Rights and Gender Equality, honestly congratulate, together with the leading person working on the MEDIA series of programmes, Commissioner Reding.
(DE) Mr President, Mrs Győri, Commissioner, we are all aware that both of these countries - Romania and Bulgaria - have invested a great deal in securing the external borders of the European Union.
You are a public servant and this information must be made public; it must be in the public domain.
In the past, Parliament has in two resolutions clearly called for an upward fiscal harmonisation of excise on tobacco.
Above all else, clarity and competitiveness involve ensuring that the production process meets established standards and quality requirements regarding for instance environmental protection, work and pay conditions, and animal welfare.
But in others, as the previous speaker has mentioned, national parliaments can be excluded; they can be bypassed in the process and corrupt officials can get hold of the aid without the involvement of government.
You have also shown commendable commitment and almost endless energy in promoting the European Union across the continent, and your mission in particular to Europe's young people has marked your work.
The position expressed by the Commission can be summarised as follows.
Closure of the sitting
So we must both try to find solutions together.
Amendment No 18 seeking to delete Article 7 is not acceptable to the Commission because it will make the execution of the programme very difficult.
We must also take into account the typical conditions in which transport operates in different maritime regions of Europe as they can have specific features which may actually restrict the possibility of establishing common rules.
The measures adopted on the basis of Article 122 for Ireland do not regulate issues.
Those millions of euro that are taken in incomprehensibly high visa fees really are not recouped because they deepen the chasms inherited from the past, this time between European Union Member States and their neighbours.
In the service sector, which makes up a major proportion not only of our economy, but also of our employment and our competitiveness, a revamping and revision were not only logical, but essential.
At international level, we are doing everything we can to open up the public procurement markets of the world's major economies.
As I said before, an important meeting is going to take place in Geneva at the end of April, at which we believe the European Parliament should be represented according to the methods we agree. We shall be constantly and vigilantly following this issue.
It is not a case of us asking for money for ourselves, as alleged by the press.
Madam President, Commission and Council, the meeting in Bali was scarcely a source of great delight.
The Council is naturally fully aware of the appalling and deeply alarming consequences of climate change, as described in the Third Assessment Report from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, to which the honourable Member also refers.
One aspect of biotechnology research that raises particular concerns and questions is something that many of us, myself most certainly included, believe must be banned entirely.
It was my third visit since I relinquished the post of governor and my first full working visit as a Commissioner.
I cannot, however, live with the recommendation from the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development.
Question Time (Commission)
More generally, we believe that the motion for a resolution has achieved a commendable balance between the demands of fishing as an economic activity and the need for conservation.
Mr President, there was some misunderstanding yesterday on the Commission's cooperation on this point, but it has been cleared up, and the report is now ready to be voted on.
This reform, which was presented to you in various committees on 18 March, has taken into account a large number of the remarks by the Court of Auditors and our own findings.
No birds are offered for any import procedures since they would automatically and immediately be refused.

But the Commission is well aware that the funds available are insufficient and that the Ministers of Finance refused to add anything.
I would have liked to discuss working hours and the reduction of these hours but I do not have enough time.
2008 is the halfway point in the timeline for achieving these goals.
Would that not be the best way of testing our democratic commitment?
The Indonesian Government's approach in recent years of distributing the inhabitants of Java over the whole of Indonesia as a sort of dominant group now appears to be having disastrous effects.
Is this case not a clear indication that full extradition arrangements are needed, otherwise justice will be evaded and full protection not afforded to the vulnerable?
Europe must, in fact, play more of a part in this phase of the negotiations so that we can avoid a possible penalisation of the European economic system and distortions of competition.
If nothing is done about the poverty and discrimination, these clashes will continue.
It is a complex exercise. We must take care not to destroy the aspect which has made the Community so special since the very beginning, this blend, which varies according to sector, but always very subtle, of shared competences.
You are acting with caution, calmly, but purposefully.
The European Union’s credibility is at stake.
This path can only serve to strengthen the economic and financial groups, and will not lead to any improvement for the economically weakest countries and the people who live there.
These results must be widely circulated whenever possible or they must lead to additional experiments.
The draft of the amended text of the framework agreement is an expression of a more effective implementation of the changes arising from the treaty based on the relations between the two institutions.
How can we talk about competition on equal terms, when there are unequal systems of taxation?
Let me make just briefly one or two other quick observations.
The Commission is ready to work closely with you on the future negotiations which I have just mentioned.
– Mr President, even though Iran is one of the largest countries on earth, it still has a government whose actions we view with concern.
What are your demands, and what are ours?
I would point out that the fight against climate change is an EU priority that is not sufficiently addressed in this budget.
That is why the following question is now much more urgent than it was during the preparations for the first spring summit in Stockholm: how does the Commission intend to continue this ambitious process of making the European Union, on the basis of innovation and knowledge, the most dynamic and competitive economic area in the world, and enabling it to overcome the problems which I have described?
It is both an important and a great step forward and also another small step forward.
The situation as far as self-employed people are concerned is that current Community invested legal rights do not afford third-country nationals the right to provide cross-border services.
I believe we all agree that some matters should take priority - as the Commissioner said - succeeding in persuading Russia, by means of all the necessary diplomatic steps and pressure, to sign the Protocol would mean exceeding 55% of emissions, which would enable us to consider the Kyoto Protocol implemented.
Harmonisation of the electricity networks also means harmonising the price of electricity.
We will have to wait for a few years to find out whether this regulation is a good one, because that will only be the case if we actually reach the required emission levels.
in writing. - (NL) I voted against the granting of discharge, given that the European Fundamental Rights Agency is a superfluous institution, which, moreover, is hostile to the right of freedom of expression.
They are still in a holding centre with no assurance of being granted asylum and facing the possibility of deportation and death.
The question is, if this is the case, who is going to reduce production and increase recycling and recovery?
