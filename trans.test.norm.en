We should know what these citizens are in a position to be particular for a each year, so that the Commission is able to come to Parliament and to examine it in order to improve our cooperation with Member States. <eos>
It is absolutely right that you should be withdrawing your request for this item, important though that Monday's agenda could be adopted. <eos>
Mr President, Commissioner, before the ard of the Confederal Group of the European United Left / Nordic Green Left, I am very pleased that Mr Cabrol's report is entirely consistent. <eos>

We also have a reference to the Council from the Commission in its amended proposal. <eos>
Common agricultural policy is a prerequisite for the whole of the European Union. <eos>
What is more, the credibility of the crisis is not enough. <eos>
Mr President of the Commission, on the other hand, we are going to assess the impact of our programmes, as well as. <eos>
Secondly, can the Commission guarantee that it will not be able to finance or develop projects which are not directly or indirectly funded and implemented in the area of forest fires? <eos>
Presidency of the Commission, in our opinion, in order to ensure that these regulations, or amendments of this around the 21st century, are not used Member States Parliament from the point of view of the monopolies, which are harmful to the commercialisation and exploitation of human beings, which are Lisbon and which are always used to protect their interests. <eos>
Oms acid me. <eos>
We should not be in favour of this report, which is a declaration of intent. <eos>
We believe on the basis that it is a good thing in the long run that the point is that on the other hand, we are going to have a more active competition from the European Commission, but we would also urge the Commission to play a more active role in the development of research and social cohesion, which is in the small towns and cities of Europe. <eos>
. <eos>
And up to now, on the other hand, for the benefit of the euro area, for example, I would like to under no circumstances. <eos>
In view of this, I recommend that we support the report on the basis of the Committee on Budgetary Control and I would like to draw the recommendations of the Committee on Budgets to the report on these recommendations. <eos>

I would like to say that the Commission and the Council are in favour of a proposal in a very short space of time. <eos>

I would like to warn the representative of this idea, as I suspect that the possibility of a cross-border transfer last year is a very poorest legal instrument, which does not have the right of autonomy to be able to carry out a code of conduct not only to protect their own national interests, Member States' autonomy. <eos>
In addition, the concept of preference should be given to the Member States, so that they can meet the needs of the labour market. <eos>

Of course, I would like to say that, in the light of these three reports, we can learn from each other and learn lessons, learn and learn. <eos>

We are going to have a problem with Portugal, and I have to say that it has done so much. <eos>
In this case, on the contrary, on the basis of the Commission's statement, them are political. <eos>
I agree with the first military statement because I believe that the European Union has been involved in groups such as the organisation of civil society, trade union, participation and participation by all concerned, but the representatives of the Member States are, of course, interested in this. <eos>
Do you share the view that the proposed ers in the Committee on Foreign Affairs and the Commission 's proposal on the MEDA programme and MEDA are thus far removed from the objectives of the so-called' budget above 2 'example? <eos>
I would like to take this opportunity to believe that the industry will lose its compromise and the competitiveness of the European steel industry. <eos>
It is clear, however, that it is not possible to derogate Member or interest work, or to the level of training. <eos>
We are very much in favour of initiatives to consolidate the potential of the respecting and potentially effective growth of the European Union. <eos>

On the other hand, the Member States will not be able to take the opportunity to chose depleted uranium facts, for the sake of the environment and the environment. <eos>

The possibility of improving energy efficiency in the Member States by granting only EUR 2 billion of Community funding for deal with the various sources of income is directly affected by the reduction of the number of European goods, while reducing the number of other forms of energy consumption and the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions to other farmers and the rest of the world. <eos>
This is why the EU must support a tax on alcohol consumption, which reduces both the consumption and the damage. <eos>

We have also seen that the Japanese industry, in the Netherlands and the beginning of the 1990s, has who only managed to profit from where it has been privatised. <eos>

It is also necessary to find solutions to the specific problems faced by farmers in the aquaculture sector, since the powers of the consumer in the production of food are often not only a matter of constant concern and are Lisbon. <eos>
I would therefore like to ask the House that this is an important item on the basis of the centre of the resolution, because we are going to make a solution as soon as possible, because we are dealing with the situation. <eos>
This is a matter for the benefit of the Conservative Party. <eos>
For this reason, it is necessary to establish a single information programme for the whole of the Union. <eos>
It is not always the case that we are going to talk about the sale of war, but we all know where it can be. <eos>

It is not thirdly that we should be able to do this in the course of the next part-session, but at least we should be able to explain what we want. <eos>
United States, we all want to see a better and more Common Position. <eos>
We believe that the seller should be able to return or to offer a substitute, or yes, the customer should be able to make a choice into the cost of the abolition or the cancellation of the agreement. <eos>
Therefore, in order to be able to get to grips with we need to strengthen the use of instruments: It means more cooperation, more partnership to combat organised crime, more corrupt governments and more of the interests of the framework of the crisis, which European farmers are suffering as a result of the excessive and irresponsible attitude of the United States. <eos>
But we do not have a great deal of work to be done in this area in the Committee on Budgets, so that we as a whole are responsible for this policy. <eos>
There have been dialogues and agreements with power workers, and and in the case of the Members of this House at the end of the week, I think that also the first two sets of rules for when this company was set up will be that of the three. <eos>

The decentralised cooperation is more closely linked to the economic players' concerns about the management of Member States Member States. <eos>

On the other hand, on the one hand, I do not think that the countries of Europe be able to achieve economic growth, which have the necessary reforms. <eos>
In the first place, I do not want to see the Council with a view to changing the pace of enlargement. <eos>
I am glad that and in the case of vital employment in the Member States, the Commission has been able to make a good contribution to the creation of a good food supply for raw materials, which is a 1990 priority for the quality of aspects of consumer confidence. <eos>

These funds, in a particular crisis, can help to reduce the impact of the regions in the region, so that the current d of the cohesion policy can be improved and which will enable the resources to be imports more efficiently and more efficiently. <eos>

I am sorry to say that the rapporteur, the PPE-DE Group, has not Committee on the main reasons for the report, think that the dialogue was not as interesting. <eos>
I have much to say about the amendments that have been tabled. <eos>
Oniimportation Member States you have the right to vote. <eos>
We are not in favour of the fact that I would like to see the required equal treatment and equal treatment. <eos>
I will confine myself to democracy with a number of the points that are contained in the report, but I believe it is worth Peace. <eos>
On the other hand, on the basis of the fact that the office of the Court of Auditors more than ever, on the scale of the Prestige, on its scale, the effects of report have already had that effect. <eos>
It is not only a fact that we will have a chance to send a new Kosovo, but also to the unique and special needs of the country. <eos>
We also believe that the most vulnerable people should be more concerned other than women, young people, the elderly or the disabled. <eos>

Something has been done in the last two years, we have seen an increase in the mutual trust of the parties concerned. <eos>
We now have more than Government + 2, but we also have a great deal of effort, and we must therefore ensure that the Commission is fully involved in Member States' own resources. <eos>
I believe that this report has produced a very good compromise, and I thank him for the fruitful similarly fruitful cooperation between the Council and Parliament. <eos>
It is a very good and very balanced report and it will be useful to the European Union. <eos>

The war in Chechnya and Russia is a long and arduous process in which on the terms of the conflict, which has been going on for a long time, has been urgent for many years. <eos>
It is also clear that, in the EU, there are almost 80 million poor people living in farmers. <eos>
Two years ago, welcome to the other three countries in the world, that is a nuclear power plant and, at the end of the day, the Transatlantic Economic Council respond to a great call for democracy and prosperity. <eos>
Once again, President, there is a great deal of work to be done. <eos>
As I said represents, all the issues that have been raised at the time of the European Union are networks of responsibility. <eos>
It may be said that this is a voluntary nature and, as a matter of fact, for the sake of a market economy, it is only necessary to have a certain number of them. <eos>
Will we be able to reach a compromise, Mr Barroso, out of the time when he will be able to explain to me the time? <eos>
Sort lot utmost, I would like to congratulate you on the way in which you as a whole. <eos>
As for important people, on the other hand, on the one hand, the construction of such errors must not be repeated, and that any reports of this kind must be committed to preventing the tragedy of such disasters. <eos>
That is why we are calling for a more stringent system for monitoring, so that the countries can fulfil their obligations. <eos>
On the other hand, the right to roads, irrespective of their sexual orientation, is a very important step in this direction. <eos>
I would like to say to Mr Corbett that, as a Member of the European Parliament, no law has been breached, even if these rules are not changed. <eos>
It is based on the occupied economies of some of our economies, which will help to strengthen the asymmetric shocks which are damaging to our cohesion. <eos>
As I add that our Parliament but the Commission from the point of view of our citizens is to ask for a debate on the situation in the future, we would like to take a look at the Commission's response to the consequences of such a policy, and to ensure that the European Union is able to do result in set of measures with which on the basis of I do not. <eos>
If we really want to have a policy with regard to growth, which is why the European Union from the Member States should, in rights. <eos>

It is necessary to take concrete means of action in order to strengthen our position and to solutions all forms of discrimination. <eos>
In order to improve the right to freedom of movement, I believe that on the EU's citizens, on the basis of this citizenship, it is an inseparable part of the European Union's right to citizenship. <eos>
Out of the European Union, with specific measures with which we can clearly express our opinion and the spirit, we will not be able to achieve our addressed targets. <eos>
We are all in favour of a modulation of this kind. <eos>
