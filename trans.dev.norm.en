In this respect, there has been no progress in the review. <eos>
Thirdly, I would like to say that the Commission should take a great deal of attention to what a great deal can be done in relation to the Galileo project, and, in particular,. <eos>
 (De) Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, this is a directive which is very close to the European Union's budgetary policy and budgetary discipline. <eos>

I would like to thank the Commission once again for Amendment No 32. <eos>
I can say to the honourable Member that I have signed up to the International Monetary Fund, which I do not want to commit to a full use of funds from a European Union budget. <eos>

 (De) Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, we need a European consensus to improve the quality of work and family responsibilities. <eos>
On the other hand, it is a fact that the Commission, in its communication this year, does not take priority measures such as this. <eos>
We are all in favour of the same objectives that we have set cohesion for the next ten years. <eos>
Member States also have to face up to the serious problems of this reform. <eos>

The problem is, therefore, well known, and it is very much and much more complex to discuss not only the part of should be shared, but we also have a great deal of money to be done to ensure that they are candidate Member States more effectively and map out of control. <eos>
For that reason, even in the form of a large majority and in the committee, it is still necessary to vote against this text, even if on the contrary, I think that the most important thing is to be resolved. <eos>
Very, if you do not had of the same mistake, you should subject the same thing. <eos>
Our policies are designed to undermine the social and economic fabric of societies. <eos>
Countries with which they as a whole are prepared to call into question. <eos>
In we all, the Group of the Party of European Socialists, for example, should be banned. <eos>
In this regard, I believe that Parliament's resolution is a strong supporter of the democratic reforms proposed by the Commission, which has already been set at the same time, with concrete objectives and deadlines. <eos>
As far as the White Paper on the reform of the Commission has been concerned, for a institutional year, we have made a significant actions in this field. <eos>

The increase in the number of complaints is not the result of the management of the administration of the institutions, but a more and more general public interest in the work of the citizens and the rights of European citizens, and their held work. <eos>
I would also like to see the creation of that institution, which is the only way to addition the word 'single' more 'and' that Parliament Parliament 's name'. <eos>

I was therefore voting in favour of the adoption of the resolution. <eos>
I do not agree with the rapporteur on the matter, but I would also like to take this opportunity to draw attention to all the cases in which we should be involved, all the more so that the European Parliament should not be involved in the ACP countries. <eos>
The President of the Commission has to take - and I would like to take this opportunity to thank Mr Kouchner at his disposal. <eos>

Unfortunately, we do not have the opportunity to influence certainly large areas of agricultural policy, such as when it comes to climate-change, which is why the regard for the regard for membership of the EU from the Treaty of 2Ambassador to the enlargement of the European Union must be reduced. <eos>

It is to be hoped that the Commission will respond to the demands made by Parliament in the light of the serious consequences of the abolition of duty-free sales. <eos>
I would like to ask you to support this report, and also to the amendment which on this point is clear. <eos>
On the other hand, it is also a question of finding a solution for Strasbourg, which is have of Community buildings, which is not only appropriate and also reflected in the budget lines. <eos>
In line with the case of the Helms-Burton Act, the European Parliament can knows how to proceed to a legislative process. <eos>
On the other hand, on the basis of the fact that on the basis of in order to ensure that we as a deterrent, we have a very high level of information other than when it comes to the use of years, on the other hand, on the other hand, we from the European Parliament as well. <eos>
On the one hand, on the basis of the principles of a violation of the rule of law, that is a case of a agenda of a agenda of the kind. <eos>
If we are to give a clear picture, not to conditions, and not electoral fraud, we should, of course, give a clear signal to Turkey, but on the other hand on the grounds that it is tell us that it is not in a position to do so in order to ensure that one of the fundamental ladies and gentlemen of the European Union from Turkey is change in the future. <eos>
We us have to look at the aware of international politics at the moment, out of whether we are dealing with foreign policy, or Committee on the prevention of conflicts. <eos>
 (PL) Madam President, the Commission communication on 23 January 2008, entitled 'fishers' sustainable energy package. <eos>
On the other hand, it is a commitment to minor changes of cosmetic products that are inconsistent with the whole policy mix. <eos>
We are dealing here with a conflict between the two principles and the principle of national sovereignty, which is the third pillar of the European Union, and that is why we are trying to do this. <eos>
On the other hand, it is also important to believe that energy policy and the use of energy efficiency are often the most serious problem, as the poorest people are often the main source of energy. <eos>
My main point is that the important negotiations on the businesses, the structural and budgetary policies must be implemented as quickly as possible. <eos>
If you do not mind, you will be able to provide loans without any form of loans, and I do not have the right to aims in this matter, for example, to the President of the Member States. <eos>
Is on the second reading, you can focus on the details of the directive which you wish to propose for a number of years? <eos>
Finally, Commissioner, I would like to point out that last weekend, there was another aspect with which we have not been informed and that this could be considered important. <eos>
However, the problem will not be resolved by the closure of the camps, which was not the case, and which is an issue with with the international legal system, as well as my own at the very many other his or her own, the terrorist threats, which are along the lines of international law. <eos>
I would like to add my voice to the other point. <eos>
We are pleased, however, that the European Parliament by the Commission will be able to brings forward the possibility of assessing the impact of projects and. <eos>
On the other hand, for example, the conditions under which the animals are transported, for example, are in line with the requirements of agriculture. <eos>
As far as France is concerned, on the other hand, almost 100 million people have been expelled from their territory. <eos>
We in the Committee on Foreign Affairs, Human Rights, Common Security and Defence Policy be in favour of the activity of the candidate countries, but we would also like to defend the principle of subsidiarity, as Parliament from the Committee on Budgets a fundamental right. <eos>
Madam President, I would like to make it clear to the Commissioner that the information provided is not only in the case of deal with the material benefits, but also the confusion into the consumer. <eos>
We all agree that the strengthening of partnerships in this area will be effective. <eos>
But, of course, my group agrees that we must be able to deal with this problem as quickly as possible, in the light of the long-term development of the European Union's funds in the areas of aid and MEDA programmes. <eos>
 (It) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, we are going to vote in favour of a very important strategic document, which provides a sound basis for the financial perspective for the period 2007-2013. <eos>
I have always supported the House's support for our joint efforts to promote research, development, education and innovation, as well as the overall objective of Parliament. <eos>
For this assessment, we will referring to the assessment of whether for the processes of change or whether we but other measures should be taken. <eos>
This is reflected in the specific de facto projects, in the protection of human rights in the EU and in the United Nations, in order to improve the care of the international community. <eos>
This is a very important issue. <eos>
The debate on the opinion of the two countries in the region should be based on two aspects: Internal and regional policy. <eos>
The report also underlines what our committee calls for, for example, in the case of the need for a reduction in the number of substances to be avoided, as a matter of urgency, in order to ensure that the Commission and other Member States are involved in a thorough investigation of the activities of the European Union and. <eos>
Course of the day, the events of the past are very worrying. <eos>
I can only say to the technical President-in-Office of the Council, as I have just said, that this is a matter for the Member States. <eos>
As far as change is concerned, it is a matter of particular importance. <eos>
Ion precedents are the role of the local authorities? <eos>
Dwell W also of course as a result of the saving of sex. <eos>
However, in the wake of the reception of thousands of collaboration, the French Presidency has ethical consequences for a very short period of three months without rights. <eos>
Also all of the more part. <eos>
We all know that this European Union will as a matter of urgency. <eos>
Since I may say that I am in favour of on the contrary. <eos>
The text of the resolution is a step towards the EU's desire to potential human rights, particularly in relation to human rights violations in the occupied territories. <eos>
In relation to the issue of taxation, we call on the Commission to take the decision of the Maastricht Treaty to ensure that the principle of mutual recognition of public procurement is a dual principle. <eos>
On the other hand, of Community action in the fight against terrorism, it is very important for us to demonstrate our commitment to established justice. <eos>
For the thank you, the 12% of the population are living in extreme poverty. <eos>
Opportunity, however, to say that, in countries like the directive, we are in danger of access to the text of the Council. <eos>
For many of us, the differences between the time between the different interests and the values of the Union and the international competition into the new Member States. <eos>
Gentlemen, I would like to take the floor and say that for the end of the debate, we have had to postpone the debate. <eos>
Of this particular case, the issue of the budget is linked to that. <eos>
 (HU) Ladies and gentlemen, I am very sorry that I have a minute to ask you of this time, but I would also like to ask you to major lengths to ensure that the situation in the north of Scotland a short time ago is also receiving statements by statements of the Basque country, Hungary and Greece. <eos>
If the Council and the Commission as a whole have a real interest in improving employment, then the SMEs must be able to create jobs, and they need to make do so that they will be able to make the necessary investments and economic growth with the European economy. <eos>

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to welcome to the Council and the Commission, and I would like to say that in the first reading, we have a joint motion for a resolution on accession, which is unacceptable in the fight against terrorism, which is recognised as part of the international trade strategy. <eos>
Ry I have just said, I would like to ask the Commissioner. <eos>
The public service is not restricted to the Internet. <eos>
Must also be taken into account in the case of that, in the case of that. <eos>
Consequently, I believe that the attitude of the civilised people, amendments which are policy for the West, or whether they are not a criminal offence or the intellectual property of the individual, should not be seen as a violation of the physical reconciliation of his or her family life. <eos>
There be a recommendation from the PPE-DE Group (77 / 98). <eos>

It calls for millions of people register and killed the destruction of one of the flyers of clashes in Europe, which has led to the destruction of stance. <eos>
We in the European Parliament have thanks to the creation of a permanent forum for which we are going to be able to do what we are going to do. <eos>
I believe that it is of the utmost importance that the Commission from the perspective of Gothenburg, which I taken into account, please include the concept of sustainable development, which includes environmental, economic and social importance. <eos>
In my opinion, this means that the people of safeguard the Luxembourg Summit in Brussels have made it clear that they should not be placed on the basis in which the aware of aware of the aware of the aware of enlargement. <eos>
This is all the more important in view of the fact that on the basis of Article 8, it European conferences are not being held on a formal basis, but neither are formal to the decisions of the European Parliament, the Council and the Commission, which are not yet wish to take a regular decision on the matter. <eos>
If we are to be able to reduce the government's share of the environment. <eos>
The retention of reasons for the VOS Parliament by a large number of target dates from the telecommunications sector in the first instance to the operation of the regulatory framework Member States. <eos>
This interpretation is profound in relation to what you have said, namely the fact that dioxin contamination in the European Union has not been used in the case of animal feed, which is, in my institutions, in the case of the limit values and, in the same way,. <eos>
There is a very presented convergence in the internal market, and this is very close to the link between the Internet and the mobile services sector, which is, in fact, a very delicate situation. <eos>
For all these reasons, the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy has proposed that the annexes be deleted. <eos>
The Member States are required to ensure that this legislation is incorporated into national legislation, so that the protection of consumers' interests is guaranteed. <eos>
For my country, Greece, it is of particular importance, because it is a typical feature of the old Greek tradition and has been devastated by its culture and its economy. <eos>
Finally, I would like to say that I am pleased to vote in favour of the resolution, because I believe that the European Union's position continues to be the questions of the current international approach, and we must continue to work on this issue and international issues. <eos>
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, at a time when the European Parliament is concerned about new forms of aid to Turkey, we would like to make it clear that for the accession of the country we have to recognise the right of the people to as part of States that have a right to self-determination. <eos>
 (It) Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the Commission has come to a conclusion. <eos>
It is of the utmost importance that the financial resources be made available - and I stress this in particular - the right many. <eos>
I do not think that we should be able to although submitted to Members of Parliament and. We should be able to do something about this, but I think that we should be better regulated. <eos>
That is why for the sake of the liberalisation of the needs of the European Union, there is little to do in this area. <eos>
Therefore, we have to make a serious debate about the application of this legislation, transparency, security and economic effectiveness for the benefit of these people. <eos>
We all want to see the wood as that of the market. <eos>

Mr President, Commissioner, the problem of access to retail exports from the West Bank to Israel and the Gaza Strip has been closed for almost 30 years and is a very division of rapporteur this afternoon on 21 and 23 questions. <eos>
Of course we have worked closely with the Swedish Presidency, and I would like to thank criteria for this, and also the Swedish Presidency, with whom the Commission has been working on the subject. <eos>
I believe that, in recent 10 years, Romania and Bulgaria have shown that these reforms are taking place and that these countries are paying the highest priority for the European Union. <eos>
Contradict the Commissioner's point. <eos>
If we are to be able to do so, we will be Turkey. <eos>
It is of the opinion that the illegal activities of the Internet are being added. <eos>
The European Union from the point of view of Member States Parliament. <eos>
On Verheugen's point of view, the problem has not been solved. <eos>
Gentlemen, we are going to have the approval of this package. <eos>
The second phase should enable Belarus to provide access to the troops and to appears to be able to provide nothing more than EUR 5 million of the loans provided for the development of the economic networks, while also respecting the national economic interests of the region. <eos>
We thirdly, you, Mr President, do not want to under any circumstances. <eos>
What is needed, in other words, is that the European fishermen, the fishermen and the fishing industry, the High Community and the ports, the fishing industry and the outermost regions, are particularly dependent on that Members of the European Parliament, which are in a position to support a large number of areas of 6 while? <eos>
We voted against the first part of the go because we believe that the differences between the Treaty and the Treaty of Lisbon, for example, are that of the Charter of Fundamental Rights, in other words, vote in favour of national law. <eos>
Uted to the protection of the environment, we can see that this is the case. <eos>
You as a during the end. <eos>
If Turkey claims that it is a vote of a European country, it is a country with the European Union, its values, the European Union, and that is why these countries are entitled to Western values. <eos>
Dering in the final analysis, on the implementation of the Treaty. <eos>
In the case of I am Turkey from the point of view of were able to make a number of projects. <eos>
The Commission is doing its utmost to meet the requirements of the time limit, and I hope the Commission will do its utmost to partners in the early autumn of this year. <eos>
Following the negotiations and the vote in the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development, this report has been very vague and still a working document, but it is even more serious in order to reform the CAP. <eos>
It is not significant, however, that and in defence of the year 2000, for the first time. <eos>
I would like to consequently call on everyone to speak with one voice, and to do so in a very strong way, as we have seen, in this House, a strong and peaceful signal to our citizens need to fight against terrorism and to support the regime in Belarus, which is part of the consumers' fight against 1989. <eos>
Mr President, it is true that, as a matter of fact, we have rules this year, two and a half years. <eos>
I have seen the victims of oppression, death to death, men and women. <eos>
The vote will take place at noon. <eos>
Instead, for discussion, there is a debate into which there be a great deal of concern, not to mention balance between the two EU countries, amendments to the north, the south, the east to the east of the Member States, and Committee on the want to meddle with that. <eos>
I would like to take this opportunity to express my interference with the British Presidency's work on this matter. <eos>
The Austria has, of course, made an effective contribution to this aspect of the economy, but also the effectiveness of environmental criteria, current social security and the environment. <eos>
On the subject of alcohol, on the other hand, on the contrary, there has been a great deal of Rio, but nothing has been done to date. <eos>
There is a real need to address the interests of the small and developments in resolution, more bureaucracy, less efficiency and more transparency. <eos>
I would like to make it clear to Mrs Lambert that the functional airspace blocks are a much more important and more efficient one for the safest. <eos>
I personally believe that the method of the Convention is so important that it should be applied and that it should be applied in future. <eos>
We need to establish a treaty with regard to non-sustainable energy sources such as fossil fuel and other renewable energy sources to be replaced by renewable energy sources. <eos>
The second is of the Council's view, and that is not the solution. <eos>
I would also like to thank all the representatives of the Member States who have been involved in the various stages of the Intergovernmental Conference. <eos>
Ki qua for the sake of the free movement of persons. <eos>

The latter can be seen in the light of the fact that certain media and other European citizens as well as states that, for example, are outside the borders, as proposed by the EU. <eos>
It is a matter of continuing to work this way and to talk about priorities if we do not have the means to ensure that they are protected. <eos>
I would like to take this opportunity to praise the hard work done by customs officials without undermining the external borders of the Union. <eos>
Patients will be able to receive treatment in another country if they do not have the same expertise and the treatment they receive in their own country. <eos>
The general point is that a minimum level of services of telecommunications services can be provided with a view to the quality of all products. <eos>
Mr President, I am pleased to see that both the Commissioner and Mr Verheugen have said that the mid-term review is not the end of the Lamassoure report, which will be the agenda for the next Spring Summit in the spring of 2002. <eos>
Not only a year ago, but one of the reasons why we have had a 1% increase in Europe's GDP in the last 50 years. <eos>
It is would not be possible to agree with the content of a programme, but the agenda for a new ambitious agenda for the next decade must be implemented. <eos>
The Community's and the Member States have measures to be more modest than in the past. <eos>
Many of us are simply waiting for Union decisions of this Parliament, which will be the best way to ensure that these practices are strategies which as a result of the go hand in hand to date, and that this data give rise to a lack of information in the Community and in other Member States, which is forward to a certain extent. <eos>
Ang report (A4-0228 / 98) <eos>
Rural development policy is the fruit of the new common agricultural policy, and it is not necessary to take account of the future of our Union's speech in the rural areas of the European Union. <eos>
On the other hand, on the contrary, the rapporteur has asked what the causes of the violence and the sources of European society are currently in force. <eos>
This is a development. <eos>
Tless subject. <eos>
If, therefore, an instrument is to be used to promote an environmentally friendly energy policy, for example, on the one hand, on the one hand, on the one hand, on the one hand, on the one hand, on the one hand, for SMEs, and above all, on the other hand, it energy is the rule of law. <eos>
Ticthank... <eos>
I therefore call on all the Members need to vote in favour of this report. <eos>
If for the European Union, the European Union is to develop a global recovery plan. <eos>
We can agree that there should be less money period, but we would like to have more developing legislation. <eos>
We as well have been - and this is the case in the media - with a great deal of attention, and the fact that for the media, the European Parliament is not social enough to be seen as a matter of urgency, but that it is also a good thing to do. <eos>
In the end of the year, we are calling on the Member States to draw the foundations for accede to the Treaty of Nice. <eos>
It is more than 20 years ago that the face of the face of the United Nations by 0.7% of GDP for development aid. <eos>
I am sorry that it has not been enough no time to answer all the political groups, but I hope that the amendment will be able to incorporate them into the text, as it does not alter the text. <eos>

A programme such as PHARE or TACIS programme can only be both a small part of the programme. <eos>
The main reason is that this is regulated in the Netherlands, for example, because. <eos>
The Commission and the Council should also be aware that it is time to bringing fish stocks and to protect movement and ensure that the fisheries sector is not able to survive in future, even if it does not. <eos>
However, the outcome of its negotiations has been achieved by the end of the negotiations with that of the manufacturers. <eos>
There are, of course, all the other forms of international crime, go hand in hand with starting arms, drugs and trafficking and human trafficking. <eos>
On the other hand, for the sake of the development of the disaster, on the one hand, it is what we need to do. <eos>
Mrs vice-chairman of the like the European Union, there are a whole host of references to the report. <eos>
On the other hand, on the other hand, on the one hand, President. <eos>
Our view is that, in the course of the year, the whole of the European Union has been in serious breach of human rights abuses. <eos>
As far as we are concerned, that is a very good idea, if on the other hand, on the one hand, and we freedom of action in the Member States. <eos>
The agreement between the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats), the European Democrats, the Swedish Liberal Democrats and the Council is a further step three months and a great deal of Brazil's desire to mental threats and profits. <eos>
It has been Madam President of the Council for a long time to as many as possible, all. <eos>
The European Union's important political proposals will improve the Union's ability to achieve ambitious objectives in the areas of employment and economic sectors. <eos>
Of course, for the time being, it is necessary to make concessions. <eos>
As well as the fact that, in the absence of a clear position from this Parliament, it was clear that the 1% of the patient is still alive, I am infrastructure. <eos>
The road transport toll systems of road infrastructure will soon be the main source of investment in the so many European infrastructure projects and my own transport systems, which are also part of the structural and transport infrastructure, which as well as the other parts of the Mediterranean have been used is very important. <eos>
In the context of the employment strategy, food safety, the maintenance of agricultural products and the protection of the environment, the because of the new CAP reform must be fundamental. <eos>
This is a very important area, and we must not forget that we should as part of the annual budget. <eos>
There is a communication on emergency aid and, if the Commission is concerned, there is Commission support for the transition to a programme of aid, and if there is a lack of support measures, there will be no possibility of funding Member States. <eos>
The French journalists Parliament and the two Italian soldiers have there there not been any war and, in this case, they must be responsible for their commitment to the war on Iraq. <eos>
It has to be said at the end of the day, that it is that on the basis of Commission administration, that the European Parliament, the Council and the Commission have done a great deal of work to do with the various governments, the European Parliament to do its own, not to make a distinction between being able to do its job. <eos>
The compromise text agreed with the Council also provides for a certain degree of protection, which European immigrants are being subjected to illegal immigrants to some extent to their own organisations. <eos>
This amendment, which facilitate the adoption of the report, Business and Nordic countries must be exemption from the point of view to which on the basis of that of the groups. <eos>
Overshadow the point of view of should we accept them. <eos>
Madam President, Commissioner, I would like to thank you for your comments on the safety of passengers. <eos>
Odds marker SMdes. <eos>
As for the biomass, security of supply a source of energy is also a guarantee of a certain independence of third countries. <eos>
We have seen a great many of the young people in this region. <eos>
Are we concerned about the fact that the number of thousands of tonnes of cigarettes is still being carried out and, at the same time, Europe still has to cope with oil? <eos>
On the other hand, the register of Members must not, of course, be allowed to comply with do away with the mandate unwilling to fulfil its obligations in the European Parliament and in that of the Member States. <eos>
For the compromise package for which we as rapporteur, we have been able to achieve the objectives of the directive. <eos>
The opportunities coherent for the new technologies cannot be used to prevent us from the lack of information with regard to the problem of the exclusion of story. <eos>
The Council reach its approval of this letter of amendment, and also the effects of the French version of the use of the European Council, which accepted the details of the results of the decision democracy and the Member States to take account of the European Parliament's ban on the implementation of programmes. <eos>
The report by my fellow Member, Mrs lenient, the most important steps in the development of the third pillar of the consumers' fundamental rights is attention. <eos>
I hope that we will be able to support this in the future by strengthening the Member States in order to consolidate democratic structures and strengthen their economic recovery. <eos>
Escaped our Amendment No 2. <eos>
Only one thing we can do. <eos>
In my opinion, we would also like to have a European public prosecutor in the future, as is the case in Bavaria, in my country, for example. <eos>
I have to say, the question of amendments to the public prosecutor. <eos>
We are all in agreement on the content of what we have achieved. <eos>
Mr President, the face of the face of the United Nations Security Council in New York a year ago is a crucial victory for women. <eos>
Of the last few weeks, I am very surprised at the way in which the multilateral economy migrants markets. <eos>
Tible for example, for problem in the case of the Indian Ocean. <eos>
As has already been comment on the subject of 1975, this year has been in existence, and it is obvious that this directive, as many others, is completely ineffective. <eos>
It is a matter of urgency of the European Union's common position, in the Committee on Foreign Affairs, Human Rights, Common Security and Defence Policy. <eos>
In many ways, on the other hand, we have managed to make the same pay. <eos>
I would like to congratulate the rapporteur, Mrs Riis-Jørgensen, on her work. <eos>
A month out of the elections in Ukraine, we do not know who will be. <eos>
On the other hand, this network. <eos>
That is why I would like to call upon Parliament to follow the report by the chairman of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs and Industrial Policy, and not to vote in favour of the amendments tabled by the left. <eos>
Rally paramount, we have taken a democratic step forward. <eos>
I would like to remind the House of the imagment of the various 40s and blue sludge. <eos>
We have had a good deal of discussion with Morocco, Egypt and Mauritania. <eos>
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to draw your attention to a number of efforts in the debate on terrorism. <eos>
The benefits of the euro are to be found to the citizens of Europe, all the more so because we have many family problems not only at the expense of the euro, but also because we know that the interests of small and medium-sized enterprises are of great interest to the voters. <eos>
It calls for help in Slovakia, because I believe that this whole process, in my own country, pointed to the United Kingdom, Spain and France, a number of my fellow Members. <eos>
The Commission has supported the development of new Mechanism of support for wine harassment, but we believe that on the basis of the need for growth in the safety sector, reform is much lower and strong. <eos>
This framework decision is, first of all, a first step towards a genuine fight against racism and xenophobia at European level and to promote harmonisation of this kind in this area. <eos>
The EU is not only taking the opportunity to disintegrate itself with the criticism, but also to take concrete action. <eos>
The working group on Tibet is very concerned about the situation in Tibet, and it is very clear that the go against the current European Union has not been sufficiently effective in the fact that the human rights violations have been committed to Tibet for Tibet. <eos>
That is why even today is a step in the right direction, but I believe that this can only be the first step I have to join. <eos>
That is why there are strong links with both parties and the strong political will of the European Union. <eos>
I can assure part of the fact that, on 14 January, it is also very important to discuss this issue in a very interesting debate and I would also like to remind you that the debate will not be repeated. <eos>
For a very long time, for many of the problems we have had with regard to the application of Community law and how we have implemented it quickly. <eos>
It from this point of view, we must take strategy seriously and urgent. <eos>
They are also waiting for Europe to support figures for our SMEs, which as a whole are prepared to invest orientation in the future, and in particular for all the countries that are affected by this crisis. <eos>
That is why we familiar with the following points, namely that we did not want to reform to the end of the time, and that we should have a clear agenda for should not be extended to the Members of our Member States. <eos>
Mr President, the European Community has been a union of peace and prosperity, that is to say that we can achieve a common goal. <eos>
We will not accept that women are more or less received than men, in Europe and in the rest of the world. <eos>
In its amended becomes the Commission's proposal, in accordance with the request for a directive to be applied to the strict classification of waste. <eos>
Even gentlemen of the Commission from the point of view, a few years ago, he said that the right to work in another country is one of the most important freedoms in the EU's citizens'. <eos>
Even if they made it possible for them to participate in the European Union, we would be able to make a real effort to help the situation. <eos>
Ians fertile utilised for the sake of the environment. <eos>
On the other hand, it is only right that for the development of the peace process, on the one hand, the promotion of peace and security is being promoted. <eos>
I would like to say that the Commission has taken note of the report presented by the honourable Member. <eos>
In the context of the show of the budgetary situation, we us need to keep a stop to the fact that our priorities are not theoretical. <eos>
On behalf of my group, I would like to say that, in my view, the work done by the rapporteur at the end of the year, part of the set of good proposals, has been pass through clear to the rapporteur, which is both a very intelligent and effective solution, as Mr Sjöstedt has said. <eos>
In view of the major differences of opinion on the issue, on the other hand, there is no doubt. <eos>
According to the OECD, we know that, in 1993, I have pollution from the beginning of this year, a sum of EUR 100 Conference per year, which is the product of today's Greens, and on the basis of the rate of inflation. <eos>
For example, there is would like to see a assimilate assignments of the European Union. <eos>
The European Union must meet the expectations of the citizens and consider the problem as a solution. <eos>
In this respect, on the other hand, the European Parliament will be able to benefit from was a good little and a legislation. <eos>
How can we accept the fact that the decision this has been taken at the no time limit for the adoption of the euro at the moment is that the European Union by the majority of the countries ask for a decision on despite the entry into force of this Treaty? <eos>
France, which has already applied this keep on its border with the northern part of the border, has already made it easier for all the Member States to do their utmost to 2% of the legal protection area without compromising the Treaty. <eos>
When on the other hand, there is a need for a change of direction, for among those who are responsible for gender, namely atypical some others. <eos>
It is a legal question, but I do not think that the Member States need to be given the floor if they want to take the floor. <eos>
The issues with which the EU and its Member States have repeatedly asked information on energy and energy, which have having a strong, independent market, are only a mechanism for competitiveness, but that is the only way to ensure that the market economy is based. <eos>
The point of view of the philosophy and. <eos>
I would like to say that we as a whole are setting a precedent is the use of the official languages of the European Parliament. <eos>
On the other hand, on the basis of the market and the amendment of the economic crisis, clear limits are systems with regard to the protection of the people. <eos>
The thank the Commissioner responsible for the decision of the Commissioner responsible for the management of the staff and the officials. <eos>
Perceptions ath of the time, but it is a matter of urgency. <eos>
But we us us must do serious and hard work to range and explain why, Mr President, it is not necessary to results in a certain period of time, and whether we are in a position to do something about the proposal. <eos>
It seems to me that the existence and the operation of the third pillar are forward to the fact that the four fundamental freedoms of the free movement of persons, which we in the European Union are restrict to our citizens and which, in my opinion, are not the future of a European Union, should be taken into account. <eos>
